july 23 2021 1 holly crosses red bank avenue to the defunct auto repair shop slips into the driver’s seat of her prius and slams the door it’s been sitting in the sun and is hotter than a sauna but even though sweat pops on her forehead and the back of her neck almost at once holly doesn’t start the car to get the ac working she only stares out through the windshield trying to get her mind around what she’s just found out i’d put your inheritance at just over six million dollars emerson said plus another three when uncle henry dies she tries to think of herself as a millionaire but it doesn’t work doesn’t come close to working all she can see is uncle pennybags the mustachioed and tophatted avatar of the monopoly game she tries to think of what she might do with her newfound riches buy clothes she has enough buy a new car her prius is very reliable and besides it’s still under warranty there’s no need to help with jerome’s education he’s all set although she supposes she might help with barbara’s travel she’s sometimes daydreamed about going on a cruise but with covid running rampant… oough she mutters no the idea of a new apartment comes to her but she loves the place she has now like baby bear’s chair and baby bear’s bed it’s just right put more money into the business why just last year she fielded a 250000 offer from midwest investigative services to make them an affiliate with pete’s agreement she had turned them down the idea of moving out of the frederick building with its balky elevator and lazy super has slightly more appeal but the downtown location is good and the rent is right not that i have to worry about that anymore she thinks and gives a wild little laugh holly finally realizes she’s roasting and turns on the engine she rolls down the windows until the air conditioning gets some traction and looks at her list of the people she wants to interview that gives her some focus because the important thing is the case the money is just pie in the sky and as for the more troubling implication of david emerson’s bombshell she remembers her mother calling in tears after daniel hailey supposedly robbed the three of them and ran off to st croix or st thomas or st wherever she won’t think about that now later she won’t be able to help herself but in the here and now there’s a missing woman to find part of her insists she’s hiding from an ugly truth the rest of her refuses that idea she’s not hiding she’s finding at least trying to cherchez la femme holly says and takes out her phone she thinks about calling marvin brown who took bonnie’s bike to the reynolds library then has a better idea instead of brown she reaches out to george rafferty the real estate man holly explains that bonnie dahl’s mother has hired her to try and find her daughter then asks about the day he and mr brown found bonnie’s bike oh my god i hope she’s all right rafferty says hasn’t been in touch with her mom or dad i hope she is too holly says dodging his question who saw the bike first you or mr brown me i always get to my properties early so i can take a fresh look that shop used to be bill’s automotive and small engine repair looks like a teardown to me but the lifts still work and the location— yes sir i’m sure the location is fine holly thinks no such thing since the turnpike extension was opened in 2010 traffic on red bank avenue has thinned considerably did you read the note taped to the seat i sure did ‘i’ve had enough’ if i were the girl’s parents something like that would scare me to death it could mean she was leaving or it could mean you know something worse mr brown and i discussed what to do with the bike and after we looked at the shop he put it in his pickup and took it to the library because of the sticker on the package carrier right that was a nice bike i can’t remember the brand but it was nice all different gears and such it’s a wonder nobody stole it kids hang around that part of the park you know the part they call the thickets yes sir i’m aware and that ice cream place down the way kids there too all the time they play the video games inside and ride their skateboards outside have you been a private eye for long it’s a term that always makes holly want to grind her teeth she’s a lot more than an eye quite awhile yes sir just to confirm you saw the bike first right right and how long before mr brown showed up fifteen minutes maybe a little longer i make it a point to get to my properties early so i can check for vandalism plus any damages that aren’t on the sell sheet did i tell you that yes sir you did so do you think you’ll find her any leads are you hot on the trail holly tells him it’s too early to be sure of anything rafferty begins telling her that if she ever has real estate needs herself this is a prime time to buy and he has a wide selection both business and residential before he can get too far into his spiel she tells him she has another call coming in and has to take it actually she has to make one to the library at bell college my mother lied uncle henry did too she shuts that down and makes her call 2 reynolds library edith brookings speaking hello my name is holly gibney i’d like to speak to lakeisha stone please i’m sorry but lakeisha has gone north to spend the weekend with some friends swimming and camping in upsala village i should be so lucky edith brookings laughs can i help you or take a message holly happens to know upsala village a rural community that’s home to lots of amish it’s no more than twenty miles north of her mother’s house where she’ll be tomorrow she might be able to talk to lakeisha up there tomorrow afternoon if inventorying the house doesn’t take too long sunday if not in the meantime perhaps the brookings woman will be able to help i’m a private investigator ms brookings penelope dahl—penny—has hired me to look for her daughter oh gee she sounds less professional now and even younger i hope you find her we’re worried to death about bon could i come up to the library and talk to you it won’t take long perhaps if you have an afternoon break— oh come any time come now if you want we’re not busy at all most of the summer sessions have been canceled because of the you know the corona that’s great holly says thank you as she pulls out onto red bank avenue she takes another look at that big rock with its view of the street and the drivein screen a mile or two away she wonders if pete steinman aka stinky steinman sometimes visited it it wouldn’t surprise her 3 at the reynolds library holly gets both edith brookings call me edie and margaret brenner another of the assistant librarians penny mentioned edie is womaning the main desk but says they can go in the reading room where she’ll be able to see anyone who has a question or wants to check a book out i wouldn’t dare if matt conroy was here edie says but he’s on vacation mad matt margaret says she pulls a face and they both giggle into their masks he’s not really mad or anything edie says but he’s kind of a pill if you talk to him when he comes back please don’t tell him i said that puhleeze margaret says and they do their giggling thing again when the cat’s away the mice will play holly thinks but there’s no harm in these mice they’re just a couple of nicelooking young women who have had something interesting turn up on an otherwise sleepy day at work unfortunately they know very little about bonnie rae except she broke up with her boyfriend tom higgins anything else you’d have to ask keisha margaret says they were tight holly plans to do that she asks for lakeisha’s phone number and edie gives it to her did bonnie say anything about leaving town holly asks maybe just in passing like wouldn’t it be nice the two young women look at each other margaret shrugs and shakes her head not to me she didn’t edie says but you have to understand that bonnie keeps pretty much to herself she’s nice but not what you’d call a sharing soul except for keisha margaret says yes except for her let me show you something from her pocket holly takes the earring and holds it out to them in the palm of her hand the way their eyes widen tells her all she needs to know bonnie’s edie says and touches it with the tip of her finger holly allows this she knew as soon as she saw it that the earring wasn’t big enough to hope for a fingerprint including bonnie rae’s where was it in some bushes close to where her bike was found by itself it means nothing it’s a clipon and might have just fallen off you really should talk to lakeisha margaret says she’ll be back on monday i’ll do that holly says but she doesn’t think she’ll have to wait until monday 4 the library parking lot is almost dead empty and holly had no trouble getting a shady spot but the interior of her car is still plenty warm she gets the ac cranking and calls bonnie’s mom penny doesn’t even bother to say hello just asks if holly has found out anything she sounds both eager and afraid holly thinks of that volvo plastered with bonnie rae’s smiling pictures and wishes she had better news i’m going to send you a photo of an earring i picked up near where your daughter’s bike was found it’s been id’d as bonnie’s by two women who work with her at the reynolds but i want to be sure send me the picture please i will asap while i’ve got you do you by any chance have bonnie’s credit card info yes a week or so after she went missing i went to her apartment and looked at her last two visa bills it was that police detective’s suggestion visa is the only card she has i thought the bills might tell me something i don’t know what but there was nothing that stood out a pair of shoes two pairs of jeans from amazon groceries some meals she ordered in from doordash pizza from domino’s… that kind of thing what about her phone does she pay for that with her visa yes her carrier’s verizon same as mine to holly it’s the credit card that matters most text me the number on her card please include the expiration date also her cell number penny says she will holly takes a photo of the earring and sends it off when penny calls back two minutes later she’s sobbing holly calms her as best she can eventually penny gets hold of herself but holly knows the woman is starting down a dark road one that holly herself has already traveled a bit further bonnie rae might still be alive but the chances are growing that she’s not holly sits with her hands in her lap and cool air from the driver’s side vents blowing her fringe around she needs to think but the first thing that comes to her is a joke opening a new millionaire walks into a bar and… and what it’s a joke with no punchline which is somehow fitting she pushes it away and thinks about the case why would bonnie leave her bike on what’s probably the most deserted stretch of red bank avenue answer she wouldn’t why would she leave the note but take her bike helmet answer she wouldn’t leave the gun take the cannoli she murmurs—a line from her favorite gangster movie did someone grab her leap out and grab her if so then… she calls marvin brown introduces herself tells him who she is and what she’s doing then asks about the bike—did it look damaged in any way brown tells her it looked fine not a scratch on it she thanks him ends the call and puts her thinking cap back on no one leaped out and knocked bonnie off the bike the concrete in front of the former bill’s automotive and small engine repair is so full of cracks and frost heaves it’s probably beyond repair marvin brown will have to do a repave job if he really intends to do business there if the bike had landed on that rough surface it almost certainly would have been banged up she’ll have to check to be sure but for the time being she’ll take brown’s word he works with vehicles for a living after all and isn’t that what a bicycle is when you get right down to it the daughter of a liar walks into a bar check that the daughter of a liar and a thief walks into a bar she leaves the gun but takes the cannoli stop it holly mutters the bike looked good stay with that why does the bike look good it seems to her that the answer is as plain as the blue eyes she sees in her rearview mirror because bonnie stopped there stopped and got off why stop if she didn’t mean to head downtown to one of those flybynight wetakecash bus lines because she saw someone she knew because someone needed help or was pretending to need help bill hodges still sometimes speaks to her and he does so now if you go any farther out on that limb holly it’s going to break off his voice is right so she backs up… but not all the way the bike’s pristine condition suggests bonnie rae stopped of her own accord whether that was because she actually meant to leave it there or for some other reason is still an open question but again why leave the bike and take the helmet her phone bings with a text it’s bonnie’s visa info and her phone account holly can’t sit still anymore she gets out of her car calls pete huntley and begins pacing around the library parking lot sticking to the shady areas as much as she can that sun is still like a hammer—oough the first thing pete says is you took the case after all jesus holly after your mother… he starts coughing pete are you all right he gets it under control i’m fine well not fine but no worse than i was when i got up this morning holly your mother just died yes and left me quite the fortune holly thinks a new millionaire walks into a bar and… something funny happens working is good for me and i’m going up to meadowbrook estates tomorrow it seems i inherited a house i don’t want your mother’s right well good for you it’s a seller’s market assuming you want to get rid of it i do are you in the market dream on gibney how did you know i took the case tall dark and handsome has already been on the phone to me pete means jerome he wanted me to look up an address he was too lazy to look up himself holly finds this a trifle irritating we have an addressfinder app and since we pay for it we should use it once in awhile besides you need something to do as well pete besides coughing and wheezing holly’s latest turn around the parking lot has brought her back to her prius she thinks of her cigarettes in the center console thinks of coughing and wheezing and walks on what address did he want a vera steinman she lives in one of those tract houses near cedar rest cemetery what do you want i have bonnie dahl’s visa and verizon information i need to know if there’s been any activity on either account i can get that i have a source but it’s not strictly legal in fact— there’s a honk as pete blows his nose —it’s not legal at all which means it will cost and itemizing it on the dahl woman’s expense account could be risky i don’t think you need to use your source holly says i bet izzy will check for you there’s a pause except for the rasp of pete’s breathing to holly it doesn’t sound good really she practically gave me the case and i wasn’t all that surprised you know how it is in the pd now fubar which means— i know what it means tell you something gibney when i see what’s going on with the cops now i’m so friggin glad i pulled the pin tell izzy that if we find out something substantive we’ll loop her in yeah will we i haven’t decided holly says primly what’s this vera steinman got to do with the dahl girl probably nothing holly could tell pete that at twentyfour bonnie rae is hardly a girl but it would do no good pete is oldschool she once heard him complaining to jerome about the miss america pageant dropping the swimsuit competition and his goto word for breasts is either bazams or jahoobies pete i have to go if you catch the corona running around holly we’ll be shut down a lot longer i hear you pete will you call izzy yeah good luck hols really sorry about your mom she walks slowly to her prius thinking suppose someone was waiting who knew bonnie’s routine did the old boyfriend know it maybe probably and the bike she keeps coming back to the bike out front and just begging to be stolen if it had been would the missing helmet bother her so much cobbling together pieces one of the most important decisions that elon musk made about tesla—the defining imprint that led to its success and its impact on the auto industry—was that it should make its own key components rather than piecing together a car with hundreds of components from independent suppliers tesla would control its own destiny—and quality and costs and supply chain—by being vertically integrated creating a good car was important even more important was creating the manufacturing processes and factories that could massproduce them from the battery cells to the body but that’s not the way the company began just the opposite when producing their rocket ebook martin eberhard and marc tarpenning had outsourced the manufacturing process likewise when it came time to make tesla’s first car the roadster they decided to cobble it together from components made by outside suppliers in a decision that would come to haunt tesla eberhard decided that tesla would get batteries in asia and car bodies in england and drivetrains from ac propulsion and a transmission from detroit or germany this was in line with the prevailing trends in the auto industry in the early days of henry ford and other pioneers carmakers did most of the work inhouse but beginning in the 1970s the companies spun off their partsmakers and upped their reliance on suppliers from 1970 to 2010 they went from producing 90 percent of the intellectual property in their vehicles to about 50 percent that made them dependent on farflung supply chains after eberhard and tarpenning decided to outsource the building of the car’s body and chassis they went to the los angeles auto show invited themselves into the booth of the boutique british sports car maker lotus and cornered one of the executives he was a polite british guy and couldn’t find a way to tell us to go away eberhard says when we were done he was intrigued enough to invite us to the uk they eventually agreed to a deal in which lotus would supply a slightly modified version of the body of its spritely elise roadster and then tesla would equip it with an electric engine and powertrain from ac propulsion by january 2005 the eighteen engineers and mechanics at tesla had cobbled together by hand what was known as a development mule a vehicle that could be shown off and tested before being put into production to make a mule required a lot of hacking and slashing in order to jam our batteries and the ac propulsion powertrain into a lotus elise musk says but at least we had a thing that looked like a real car it actually had doors and a roof unlike the tzero straubel got to take the first test ride when he touched the accelerator it bolted forward like a startled horse amazing even its engineers eberhard’s turn came next and tears came to his eyes as he gripped the wheel after musk took his turn zipping around and marveling at the car’s superquick but silent acceleration he agreed to invest 9 million more in the company whose company one issue with startups especially those with multiple founders and funders is who should be in charge sometimes the alpha male wins as when steve jobs marginalized steve wozniak and when bill gates did the same to paul allen at other times it’s messier especially when different players feel that they are the founder of a company both eberhard and musk considered themselves to be the main founder of tesla in eberhard’s mind he had come up with the idea enlisted his friend tarpenning registered a company chosen a name and gone out and found funders elon called himself the chief architect and all kinds of things but he wasn’t eberhard says he was just a board member and investor but in musk’s mind he was the one who put eberhard together with straubel and provided the funding needed to start the company when i met eberhard and wright and tarpenning they had no intellectual property no employees nothing all they had was a shell corporation at first this difference in perspective was not a big problem i was running spacex musk says and i had no desire to also run tesla he was happy at least initially to be the board chair and let eberhard be ceo but as the person who owned most of the equity musk had ultimate authority and it was not in his nature to defer especially when it came to engineering decisions he became increasingly involved tesla’s leadership team thus became an inherently unstable molecule for the first year or so musk and eberhard got along eberhard handled the daily management of tesla at its headquarters in silicon valley musk spent most of his time in los angeles and made visits only about once a month for board meetings or important design reviews his questions tended to be technical probing into the details of the battery pack motor and materials he was not known for gushing emails but one night early in their relationship after working on a problem together he sent one to eberhard the number of great product people in the world is tiny and i think you are one of them they talked most days exchanged emails at night and occasionally socialized i was never his drinking buddy eberhard says but we were in each other’s houses every now and then and went out to eat alas they were too much alike for the buddy movie to last both were harddriving highstrung detailoriented engineers who could be brutally dismissive of those they considered fools the problems began when eberhard had a fallingout with ian wright who had been part of the founding team their disagreements became so intense that each tried to convince musk to fire the other it was a tacit acknowledgment by eberhard that musk had the ultimate say martin and ian were telling me why the other one is a demon and needs to be thrown out musk says they are saying ‘elon you must make a choice’  musk called straubel for advice okay who should we pick here he asked straubel replied that neither choice was great but when pressed he advised maybe martin is the lesser of two evils musk ended up firing wright but the situation deepened his doubts about eberhard it also prompted him to become more involved in the management of tesla design decisions as musk began to pay more attention to tesla he could not refrain from getting involved in design and engineering decisions he would fly up from los angeles every couple of weeks chair a design review meeting inspect models and suggest improvements being musk however he did not consider his ideas to be mere suggestions he bristled when they were not carried out this was a problem because the company’s business plan called for cobbling together a body from lotus and other suppliers without making major changes we had planned to do the minimal possible modifications tarpenning says at least until elon got more involved eberhard tried to resist most of musk’s suggestions even if they would make the car better because he knew they would increase costs and cause delays but musk argued that the only way to jumpstart tesla was to roll out a roadster that wowed customers we only get to release our first car once so we want it to be as good as it can be he told eberhard at one of the review meetings musk’s face darkened his stare turned cold and he declared that the car looked cheap and ugly we couldn’t have a crappylooking car and sell it for around a hundred thousand dollars he later said although his expertise was computer software not industrial design he began putting a lot of time into the aesthetics of the roadster i had never designed a car before so i was studying every great car and trying to understand what made it special he says i agonized over all the details he would later proudly note that he was honored by the artcenter college of design in pasadena for his work on the roadster one major design revision that musk made was to insist that the door of the roadster be enlarged in order to get in the car you had to be a dwarf mountain climber or a master contortionist he says it was insane farcical the sixfoottwoinch musk found he had to swing his rather large butt into the seat fold himself into nearly a fetal position then try to swing his legs in if you’re going on a date how is a woman even going to get in the car he asked so he ordered that the bottom of the door’s frame be lowered three inches the resulting redesign of the chassis meant that tesla could not use the crashtest certification that lotus had which added 2 million to the production costs like many of musk’s revisions it was both correct and costly musk also ordered that the seats be made wider my original idea was to use the same seat structures that lotus used eberhard says otherwise we would have to redo all the testing but elon felt that the seats were too narrow for his wife’s butt or something i got a skinny butt and i kind of miss the narrow seats musk also decided that the original lotus headlights were ugly because they had no cover or shield it made the car look bugeyed he says the lights are like the eyes of a car and you have to have beautiful eyes that change would add another 500000 to the production costs he was told but he was adamant if you’re buying a sports car you’re buying it because it’s beautiful he told the team so this is not a small deal instead of the fiberglass composite material that lotus used musk decided that the roadster body should be made from stronger carbon fiber that made it costlier to paint but it also made it lighter while feeling more solid over the years musk was able to use techniques learned at spacex and apply them to tesla and vice versa when eberhard pushed back on the cost of carbon fiber musk sent him an email dude you could make the body panels for at least 500 cars worth per year if you bought the soft oven we have at spacex he wrote if someone tells you this is hard they are full of shit you can make high quality composites in the oven in your home no detail was too small to escape musk’s meddling the roadster originally had ordinary door handles the kind that click open a latch musk insisted on electric handles that would operate with a simple touch somebody who’s buying a tesla roadster will buy it whether it has ordinary door latches or electric ones eberhard argued it’s not going to add a single unit to our sales it was an argument he had made about most of musk’s design changes musk prevailed and electric door handles became a cool feature that helped define the magic of tesla but as eberhard warned it added yet another cost eberhard finally got pushed to despair when near the end of the design process musk decided that the dashboard was ugly this is a major issue and i’m deeply concerned that you do not recognize it as such musk wrote eberhard tried to put him off begging that they deal with the issue later i just don’t see a path—any path at all—to fixing it prior to start of production without a significant cost and schedule hit he wrote i stay up at night worrying about simply getting the car into production sometime in 2007… for my own sanity’s sake and for the sanity of my team i am not spending a lot of cycles thinking about the dashboard many people over the years would make similar pleas to musk few of them successfully in this case musk relented improving the dashboard could wait until after the first cars entered production but it didn’t help musk and eberhard’s relationship by modifying so many elements tesla lost the cost advantages that came from simply using a crashtested lotus elise body it also added to the supplychain complexity instead of being able to rely on lotus’s existing suppliers tesla became responsible for finding new sources for hundreds of components from the carbon fiber panels to the headlights i was driving the lotus people crazy musk says they kept asking me why i was being so hardcore about every little curve of this car and what i told them was ‘because we have to make it beautiful’  raising more capital musk’s modifications may have made the car more beautiful but they also burned through the company’s cash in addition he repeatedly pushed eberhard to hire more people so that the company could move faster by may 2006 it had seventy employees and it needed another round of financing from investors tarpenning was acting as the company’s chief financial officer even though his expertise was in computer software and not finance he had the unenviable task of telling musk at a board meeting that they were running out of money this was sooner than we had originally planned largely because we had been making these hires that elon pushed for tarpenning recalls so elon totally loses it during the tirade elon’s brother kimbal who was on the board reached into his satchel and looked through the budget presentations from the previous five meetings elon he quietly interjected if you take away the costs of the six unbudgeted new hires that you pushed for then they would actually still be right on target musk paused looked at the spreadsheets and conceded the point okay he said i guess we should figure out how to raise more financing tarpenning says he felt like hugging kimbal in silicon valley at the time there was a tightknit and hardpartying community of young entrepreneurs and tech bros who had become startup millionaires and musk had become one of its stars he enlisted some of his friends to invest including antonio gracias sergey brin larry page jeff skoll nick pritzker and steve jurvetson but board members encouraged him to broaden the network and seek financing from one of the major venture capital firms such as those that gilded palo alto’s sand hill road that would provide not just money but a stamp of legitimacy on tesla first he approached sequoia capital which had become king of the  xi  into the mountains – old ephraim – a delaware carried off – the search – another probate – in the gorge – the ruins – keet seel – the solerette – representations and things – the judge tells a story – a mule lost – mescal pits – night scene with moon blossoms judge – the village – glanton on the management of animals – the trail out  they rode on into the mountains and their way took them through high pine forests wind in the trees lonely birdcalls the shoeless mules slaloming through the dry grass and pine needles in the blue coulees on the north slopes narrow tailings of old snow they rode up switchbacks through a lonely aspen wood where the fallen leaves lay like golden disclets in the damp black trail the leaves shifted in a million spangles down the pale corridors and glanton took one and turned it like a tiny fan by its stem and held it and let it fall and its perfection was not lost on him they rode through a narrow draw where the leaves were shingled up in ice and they crossed a high saddle at sunset where wild doves were rocketing down the wind and passing through the gap a few feet off the ground veering wildly among the ponies and dropping off down into the blue gulf below they rode on into a dark fir forest the little spanish ponies sucking at the thin air and just at dusk as glanton’s horse was clambering over a fallen log a lean blond bear rose up out of the swale on the far side where it had been feeding and looked down at them with dim pig’s eyes glanton’s horse reared and glanton flattened himself along the horse’s shoulder and drew his pistol one of the delawares was next behind him and the horse he rode was falling backward and he was trying to turn it beating it about the head with his balled fist and the bear’s long muzzle swung toward them in a stunned articulation amazed beyond reckoning some foul gobbet dangling from its jaws and its chops dyed red with blood glanton fired the ball struck the bear in the chest and the bear leaned with a strange moan and seized the delaware and lifted him from the horse glanton fired again into the thick ruff of fur forward of the bear’s shoulder as it turned and the man dangling from the bear’s jaws looked down at them cheek and jowl with the brute and one arm about its neck like some crazed defector in a gesture of defiant camaraderie all through the woods a bedlam of shouts and the whack of men beating the screaming horses into submission glanton cocked the pistol a third time as the bear swung with the indian dangling from its mouth like a doll and passed over him in a sea of honeycolored hair smeared with blood and a reek of carrion and the rooty smell of the creature itself the shot rose and rose a small core of metal scurrying toward the distant beltways of matter grinding mutely to the west above them all several rifleshots rang out and the beast loped horribly into the forest with his hostage and was lost among the darkening trees the delawares trailed the animal three days while the party moved on the first day they followed blood and they saw where the thing had rested and where the wounds had stanched and the next day they followed the dragmarks through the duff of a high forest floor and the day after they followed only the faintest trace across a high stone mesa and then nothing they cut for sign until dark and they slept on the naked flints and the next day they rose and looked out on all that wild and stony country to the north the bear had carried off their kinsman like some fabled storybook beast and the land had swallowed them up beyond all ransom or reprieve they caught up their horses and turned back nothing moved in that high wilderness save the wind they did not speak they were men of another time for all that they bore christian names and they had lived all their lives in a wilderness as had their fathers before them they’d learnt war by warring the generations driven from the eastern shore across a continent from the ashes at gnadenhutten onto the prairies and across the outlet to the bloodlands of the west if much in the world were mystery the limits of that world were not for it was without measure or bound and there were contained within it creatures more horrible yet and men of other colors and beings which no man has looked upon and yet not alien none of it more than were their own hearts alien in them whatever wilderness contained there and whatever beasts they cut the trail of the party early the next day and by nightfall of the day following they had overtaken them the lost warrior’s horse stood saddled in the caballado as they had left it and they took down the bags and divided his estate among them and that man’s name was never said again in the evening the judge came to the fire and sat with them and questioned them and made a map upon the ground and scrutinized it then he rose and trod it out with his boots and in the morning all rode on as before their way led now through dwarf oak and ilex and over a stony ground where black trees stood footed in the seams on the slopes they rode through sunlight and high grass and in the late afternoon they came out upon an escarpment that seemed to rim the known world below them in the paling light smoldered the plains of san agustin stretching away to the northeast the earth floating off in a long curve silent under looms of smoke from the underground coal deposits burning there a thousand years the horses picked their way along the rim with care and the riders cast varied glances out upon that ancient and naked land in the days to come they would ride up through a country where the rocks would cook the flesh from your hand and where other than rock nothing was they rode in a narrow enfilade along a trail strewn with the dry round turds of goats and they rode with their faces averted from the rock wall and the bakeoven air which it rebated the slant black shapes of the mounted men stenciled across the stone with a definition austere and implacable like shapes capable of violating their covenant with the flesh that authored them and continuing autonomous across the naked rock without reference to sun or man or god they rode down from this country through a deep gorge clattering over the stones rifts of cool blue shade in the dry sand of the arroyo floor old bones and broken shapes of painted pottery and graven on the rocks above them pictographs of horse and cougar and turtle and the mounted spaniards helmeted and bucklered and contemptuous of stone and silence and time itself lodged in faults and crevices a hundred feet above them were nests of straw and jetsam from old high waters and the riders could hear the mutter of thunder in some nameless distance and they kept watch on the narrow shape of sky overhead for any darkness of impending rain threading the canyon’s close pressed flanks the dry white rocks of the dead river floor round and smooth as arcane eggs that night they camped in the ruins of an older culture deep in the stone mountains a small valley with a clear run of water and good grass dwellings of mud and stone were walled up beneath an overhanging cliff and the valley was traced with the work of old acequias the loose sand in the valley floor was strewn everywhere with pieces of pottery and blackened bits of wood and it was crossed and recrossed with the tracks of deer and other animals the judge walked the ruins at dusk the old rooms still black with woodsmoke old flints and broken pottery among the ashes and small dry corncobs a few rotting wooden ladders yet leaned against the dwelling walls he roamed through the ruinous kivas picking up small artifacts and he sat upon a high wall and sketched in his book until the light failed the moon rose full over the canyon and there was stark silence in the little valley it may be it was their own shadows kept the coyotes from abroad for there was no sound of them or wind or bird in that place but only the light rill of water running over the sand in the dark below their fires the judge all day had made small forays among the rocks of the gorge through which they’d passed and now at the fire he spread part of a wagonsheet on the ground and was sorting out his finds and arranging them before him in his lap he held the leather ledgerbook and he took up each piece flint or potsherd or tool of bone and deftly sketched it into the book he sketched with a practiced ease and there was no wrinkling of that bald brow or pursing of those oddly childish lips his fingers traced the impression of old willow wicker on a piece of pottery clay and he put this into his book with nice shadings an economy of pencil strokes he is a draftsman as he is other things well sufficient to the task he looks up from time to time at the fire or at his companions in arms or at the night beyond lastly he set before him the footpiece from a suit of armor hammered out in a shop in toledo three centuries before a small steel tapadero frail and shelled with rot this the judge sketched in profile and in perspective citing the dimensions in his neat script making marginal notes glanton watched him when he had done he took up the little footguard and turned it in his hand and studied it again and then he crushed it into a ball of foil and pitched it into the fire he gathered up the other artifacts and cast them also into the fire and he shook out the wagonsheet and folded it away among his possibles together with the notebook then he sat with his hands cupped in his lap and he seemed much satisfied with the world as if his counsel had been sought at its creation a tennessean named webster had been watching him and he asked the judge what he aimed to do with those notes and sketches and the judge smiled and said that it was his intention to expunge them from the memory of man webster smiled and the judge laughed webster regarded him with one eye asquint and he said well you’ve been a draftsman somewheres and them pictures is like enough the things themselves but no man can put all the world in a book no more than everthing drawed in a book is so well said marcus spoke the judge but dont draw me said webster for i dont want in your book my book or some other book said the judge what is to be deviates no jot from the book wherein it’s writ how could it it would be a false book and a false book is no book at all you’re a formidable riddler and i’ll not match words with ye only save my crusted mug from out your ledger there for i’d not have it shown about perhaps to strangers the judge smiled whether in my book or not every man is tabernacled in every other and he in exchange and so on in an endless complexity of being and witness to the uttermost edge of the world i’ll stand for my own witness said webster but by now the others had begun to call to him his conceit and who would want to see his bloody portrait anyway and would there be fights break out in the great crowds awaiting its unveiling and perhaps they could tar and feather the picture lacking the article itself until the judge raised his hand and called for amnesty and told them that webster’s feelings were of a different kind and not motivated by vanity at all and that he’d once drawn an old hueco’s portrait and unwittingly chained the man to his own likeness for he could not sleep for fear an enemy might take it and deface it and so like was the portrait that he would not suffer it creased nor anything to touch it and he made a journey across the desert with it to where he’d heard the judge was to be found and he begged his counsel as to how he might preserve the thing and the judge took him deep into the mountains and they buried the portrait in the floor of a cave where it lies yet for aught the judge knew when he was done telling this webster spat and wiped his mouth and eyed the judge again that man he said was no more than a ignorant heathen savage that’s so said the judge it aint like that with me excellent said the judge reaching for his portmanteau you’ve no objection to a sketch then i’ll sit for no portrait said webster but it aint like you said the company fell silent someone rose to stoke the fire and the moon ascended and grew small over the ruined dwellings and the little stream braided over the sands in the valley floor shone like woven metal and save for the sound it made there was no sound other what kind of indians has these here been judge the judge looked up dead ones i’d say what about you judge not so dead said the judge they was passable masons i’d say that these niggers hereabouts now aint no kind not so dead said the judge then he told them another story and it was this story in the western country of the alleghenies some years ago when it was yet a wilderness there was a man who kept a harness shop by the side of the federal road he did so because it was his trade and yet he did little of it for there were few travelers in that place so that he fell into the habit before long of dressing himself as an indian and taking up station a few miles above his shop and waiting there by the roadside to ask whoever should come that way if they would give him money at this time he had done no person any injury one day a certain man came by and the harnessmaker in his beads and feathers stepped from behind his tree and asked this certain man for some coins he was a young man and he refused and having recognized the harnessmaker for a white man spoke to him in a way that made the harnessmaker ashamed so that he invited the young man to come to his dwelling a few miles distant on the road this harnessmaker lived in a bark house he had built and he kept a wife and two children all of whom reckoned the old man mad and were only waiting some chance to escape him and the wild place he’d brought them to they therefore welcomed the guest and the woman gave him his supper but while he ate the old man again began to try to wheedle money from him and he said that they were poor as indeed they were and the traveler listened to him and then he took out two coins which like the old man had never seen and the old man took the coins and studied them and showed them to his son and the stranger finished his meal and said to the old man that he might have those coins but ingratitude is more common than you might think and the harnessmaker wasnt satisfied and he began to question whether he ought not perhaps to have another such coin for his wife the traveler pushed back his plate and turned in his chair and gave the old man a lecture and in this lecture the old man heard things he had once known but forgotten and he heard some new things to go with them the traveler concluded by telling the old man that he was a loss to god and man alike and would remain so until he took his brother into his heart as he would take himself in and he come upon his own person in want in some desert place in the world now as he was concluding this speech there passed in the road a nigger drawing a funeral hearse for one of his own kind and it was painted pink and the nigger was dressed in clothes of every color like a carnival clown and the young man pointed out this nigger passing in the road and he said that even a black nigger … here the judge paused he had been looking into the fire and he raised his head and looked around him his narration was much in the manner of a recital he had not lost the thread of his tale he smiled at the listeners about said that even a crazy black nigger was not less than a man among men and then the old man’s son stood up and began an oration himself pointing out at the road and calling for a place to be made for the nigger he used those words that a place be made of course by this time the nigger and hearse had passed on from sight with this the old man repented all over again and swore that the boy was right and the old woman who was seated by the fire was amazed at all she had heard and when the guest announced that the time had come for his departure she had tears in her eyes and the little girl came out from behind the bed and clung to his clothes the old man offered to walk him out the road so as to see him off on his journey and to apprise him of which fork in the road to take and which not for there were scarcely any waysigns in that part of the world as they walked out they spoke of life in such a wild place where such people as you saw you saw but one and never again and by and by they came to the fork in the road and here the traveler told the old man that he had come with him far enough and he thanked him and they took their departure each of the other and the stranger went on his way but the harnessmaker seemed unable to suffer the loss of his company and he called to him and went with him again a little way upon the road and by and by they came to a place where the road was darkened in a deep wood and in this place the old man killed the traveler he killed him with a rock and he took his clothes and he took his watch and his money and he buried him in a shallow grave by the side of the road then he went home on the way he tore his own clothes and bloodied himself with a flint and he told his wife they had been set upon by robbers and the young traveler murdered and him only escaped she began to cry and after a while she made him take her to the place and she took wild primrose which grew in plenty thereabout and she put it on the stones and she came there many times until she was old post traumatic growth and building resilience an interview with martin ep seligman by sarah green carmichael sarah green welcome to the hbr ideacast from harvard business review i’m sarah green i’m talking today with university of pennsylvania professor martin seligman the man known as the father of positive psychology he’s the author of the new book flourish and of the hbr article building resilience in the april 2011 issue of the magazine marty thanks so much for talking with us today martin seligman glad to be here sarah green i know it’s a huge project but i’d like to start with having you just give us a quick encapsulation of the work that you’ve been doing with the united states army which is the foundation of the article martin seligman about two and a half years ago the chief of staff of the army called me to the pentagon and said suicide posttraumatic stress disorder substance abuse divorce depression what does positive psychology say about that dr seligman and there was a meeting with general staff and i said that the human reaction to extreme adversity—combat being laid off divorce—is bellshaped and on the lefthand side you got people who fall apart and those are five ways in which we fall apart anxiety depression suicide posttraumatic stress disorder and i thought the army should continue to spend 5 to 10 billion a year treating those things but the army is not a hospital and there are two really important things about the reaction to adversity the majority of people are resilient and what that means is they go through a tough time after unemployment after rejection after combat but a month or two later by our psychological and physical measures they’re back where they were and then a large number of people show what’s called posttraumatic growth and what that means is they typically go through a very hard time often posttraumatic stress disorder but a year later they’re stronger than they were before by psychological and physical measures these are the people of whom nietzsche said if it doesn’t kill me it makes me stronger so my recommendation to general casey was to measure and build resilience and to create an army which was what he wanted to do that was just as psychologically fit as physically fit sarah green well before we get into some of the how of how that happened as i was reading the article i realized just how much we in the media focus on posttraumatic stress disorder and i always come away from those articles feeling as if the only way to avoid ptsd is to avoid trauma which of course is impossible no matter who you are i think you actually do us a great service by switching the focus to posttraumatic growth but i wanted to ask you before we get more into that do you think that there is a negative impact on people of focusing so much on posttraumatic stress disorder martin seligman you’ve hit on a reality sarah we went up to west point and we asked how many of you are aware of posttraumatic stress disorder and 97 and how many of you are aware of posttraumatic growth it was about 10 and the reason that’s very important is that it’s selffulfilling in the following way so it just isn’t depression if the only thing you know about is posttraumatic stress disorder and you have some awful event and the next day you burst into tears you’re going to think i’m going under i’ve got postdramatic stress disorder and what that does is worsen the symptoms which are symptoms of anxiety and depression which in turn makes you think even more certainly that you’re going under which worsens the symptoms if on the other hand you have just a little bit of medical literacy and you know that crying and mourning and feeling very down are typical normal reactions to being fired to combat and that the usual response is resilience and sometimes growth that stops the downward spiral so it’s very important for people to know that the normal response to very bad things is not going under it’s not posttraumatic stress disorder it’s resilience and not infrequently growth sarah green let’s talk a little bit more about some of the characteristics of posttraumatic growth one of the things you mention in the article is that a key part of it is seeing the failure or the trauma as a fork in the road what do you mean by that and why is that so important martin seligman well very often extremely bad events lead to personal and moral dilemmas and they’re existential crises in which you have to make decisions and therefore we talk about it as a fork in the road one of the most interesting things about depression which is the big big component of posttraumatic stress disorder it is an emotion that tells you to detach from goals you had that they’re unreachable and that creates a fork in the road it makes you ask the question what other things might i do what doors might open for me and one of the important things about knowing about posttraumatic growth and resilience is when those doors open for you if you are paralyzed by the depression by the anxiety by the symptoms of posttraumatic growth you’re not going to walk through those doors you’re not going to take advantage of them but knowing that typically people who suffer very bad events have new doors open for them and that it’s important to be prepared to walk through them sarah green one of the other key elements that you talk about when you talk about growth after a traumatic event any event is the importance of articulating life principles why is it so important to do that as sort of the final step in growth martin seligman human beings are ineluctably creatures of narrative creatures who make meaning tell stories about their lives and to the extent you can create a narrative of your trauma a narrative of unemployment a narrative of combat in which new principles a more mature way of viewing the world arise and you can go like orpheus come back from the underground and make sense of what’s in the underground and tell the world what’s in the underground that there’s reason to think that’s an important enabling condition after trauma sarah green so i’d like to transition now into the sort of nuts and bolts of how you adapted all this information about growth and trauma into a program that would work for the us military martin seligman well starting about almost 20 years ago after i had worked on learned helplessness we began to ask the question what can you do with human beings to create the opposite of learned helplessness in the face of trauma so we developed a resilience program called the penn resilience program and we started to go to schools first to classrooms and then to whole schools and now to national school systems and we taught a set of skills to teachers and the teachers then taught them to the students and we measured the anxiety and depression in students 9 overeaters anonymous   is this the current logo for overeaters anonymous we don’t know if it’s an anonymous secret society then maybe i shouldn’t say but this is what came up when i entered overeaters anonymous into the world wide web just to remind you the lightning strike stands for me breaking the rule of anonymity claiming association in a specific twelvestep group this act of telling you about it according to the traditions is a big nono i don’t totally understand it even after thirtyfive years of supersecret enrollment i have read and reread all the conferenceapproved literature here is what i think are the reasons you’re not supposed to say what group you’re in publicly 1you’re making the group about you and you are the problem 2you’re a celebrity dumdum stop bragging 3what if you fuck up and lose your shit it’s bad advertising 4your public acknowledgment of participation in a group may prevent someone else from seeking help as that someone else may hate you 5god has good ideas stop asking questions you don’t understand you’re ruining it 6you might take over the group personalitywise as a spokesperson in the public sphere like moses for the jewish people except with a lot lower stakes 7without arbitrary rules aren’t we just people sitting in chairs suffice it to say i’m going to say which groups i’ve found tons of help in while also fearing i will be punished either as a social pariah

their own language facilities  embedding a way of fitting one manifold into another larger one as an aid to visualizing its properties for example some 2dimensional manifolds can be embedded as a surface in 3dimensional euclidean space a sphere a torus a möbius strip while others such as klein’s bottle can only be embedded in 4dimensional space the size and shape of the surface are properties of the embedding not of the manifold itself – so a sphere and an ellipsoid are two different embeddings of exactly the same manifold – but a particular embedding in euclidean space can be used to supplement a manifold with the geometrical concepts needed to make it into a riemannian space  euclidean space the euclidean space of n dimensions is a natural generalization of the 2dimensional euclidean plane where the square of the total distance between two points is the sum of the squares of their separation in each of the n dimensions the euclidean spaces are simple examples of the more general idea of a riemannian space  exoself nonconscious software that mediates between a citizen and the polis operating system  exuberant a flesher whose genes have been modified  fermion all elementary particles can be classified as either bosons or fermions the fermions include electrons and quarks and composites of three quarks like protons and neutrons the quantum wave function for two or more identical fermions reverses phase if any two particles are swapped this leads to the pauli exclusion principle which gives a zero probability for two fermions being in exactly the same state the wave function of a single fermion reverses phase if the particle is rotated by 360 degrees and is only restored exactly by two full rotations fermions have a spin which is an oddinteger multiple of half the fundamental unit of angular momentum in kozuch theory all these properties arise from the topology of the particle’s wormhole  fiber bundle a fiber bundle is a manifold the total space plus some scheme for projecting it onto a second manifold of lower dimension the base space for example the surface of a torus is a twodimensional manifold but if every longitudinal circle is reduced to a point that projects the torus onto a single equatorial circle a onedimensional manifold the set of points in the total space that is projected onto any given point of the base space is called the fiber of that point eg one of the longitudinal circles of the torus the fibers need not be identical from point to point but if they are their general form is called the standard fiber of the bundle so a torus is a fiber bundle with a circle as its base space and another circle as its standard fiber in classical kozuch theory the universe is a fiber bundle with fourdimensional spacetime as its base space and a sixdimensional sphere as its standard fiber  field a sixbit segment of a mind seed comprising a single instruction code in the shaper programming language  first generation those

euclidean space the geodesics are either straight lines in the external space or they curve in a direction perpendicular to the surface for example a great circle on a sphere is a geodesic – because so far as inhabitants of the sphere are concerned a great circle is curved only in an abstract dimension which is perpendicular to the surface’s two dimensions  gestalt 1 a data format which encompasses both images and tags conveying miscellaneous information 2 a visual language based on inflections of fleshershaped icons an enlarged version of preintrodus communication through facial

structure within konishi citizens which issues requests to the polis operating system for data to be provided to the citizen’s input channels from a particular address  intrinsic curvature in a riemannian space a measure of the extent to which tangents to a curve at two nearby points are not parallel to each other if the riemannian space is a surface embedded in euclidean space intrinsic curvature measures the amount of curvature which is within the surface as opposed to being perpendicular to it  introdus the mass influx of fleshers into the polises in the late twentyfirst century  invariant an invariant of a mathematical structure is some characteristic which remains unchanged when the structure is transformed in certain ways for example the euler number of a surface with no boundary such as a sphere or a torus is calculated by dividing the whole surface into possibly curved polygons then adding up the number of polygons minus the number of lines used to form them plus the number of points where the lines meet this is a topological invariant of the surface because it remains the same however much the surface is bent or stretched  inviolability the protection of a citizen against alteration by any other software without explicit consent  kozuch theory a provisional unified theory of physics developed in the midtwentyfirst century kozuch theory describes the universe as a tendimensional fiber bundle its size in six dimensions is submicroscopic so only the familiar four dimensions of spacetime are immediately apparent particles such as electrons are actually the mouths of very narrow wormholes an idea first suggested by the twentiethcentury physicist john wheeler renata kozuch developed a model in which the properties of different particles are due to the different ways wormhole mouths can be connected in the six extra dimensions  linear 1 a data format derived from digitized sound 2 a particular language which employs linear data widely used in the coalition of polises  manifold a topological space with a definite dimension but no geometrical properties a 2dimensional manifold is somewhat like a perfectly flexible sheet of rubber with zero thickness and a 3dimensional manifold is like a slab of the same material – with the possibility that parts of the border of this idealized sheet or slab have been joined to each other perhaps in ways which would be physically impossible in three dimensions supplementing a manifold with concepts of distance and parallelism turn it into a riemannian or semiriemannian space  mind seed a program to construct a polis citizen written in the shaper language at the binary level a mind seed is a string of approximately six billion bits  nsphere an ndimensional space without boundaries which can be embedded in n1dimensional euclidean space as the surface or hypersurface equidistant from some point for example the surface of the earth is a 2sphere and the hypersurface of a fourdimensional star or planet would be a 3sphere but the solid planets themselves in either dimension are not nspheres in this sense  outlook a nonsentient program which runs inside the exoself

the infrastructure for a community of conscious software 2 the community itself  psychoblast an embryonic software mind prior to the granting of citizenship  psychogenesis the creation of a new citizen by running a mind seed or by other methods such as the assembly and customization of preexisting components  riemannian space a riemannian space is a manifold with two added geometrical concepts a metric which is a means of computing the distance between two close points and a connection a means of deciding whether two directions at two close points are parallel in the case of a surface embedded in euclidean space the distance between two close points in the manifold can be defined as the distance between them in the external space and directions at two close points can be defined as parallel if any difference between them in the external space is perpendicular to the surface for example a horizontal compass needle pointing north at the equator is parallel in the riemannian sense with one pointing north at a slightly higher latitude – because although they’re not pointing in exactly the same direction in 3dimensional space the difference in direction is perpendicular to the surface of the earth  rush for a polis citizen to rush is to experience the passage of time between external events more rapidly by running vis own mind more slowly chapter 4 today’s priorities give me focus what would you do if you suddenly found yourself independently wealthy and the owner of a successful multimilliondollar business that’s the question howard hughes found himself facing when he was only eighteen years old hughes’s mother had died during surgery in 1922 when he was sixteen when his father died of a heart attack less than two years later the young man inherited the hughes tool company hughes’s father howard hughes sr had built his company from the ground up born in 1869 he worked in the missouri zinc and lead mining industries in the 1890s when he heard about the major petroleum discovery near beaumont texas in 1901 he recognized it as the opening of a new industry offering great opportunities in one day of production the first well had produced half the united states’ cumulative oil production he soon moved to texas and started a drilling business with partner walter b sharp for seven years they worked successfully but then they were unable to complete jobs that involved drilling two different wells because they could not drill through especially hard rock to solve the problem hughes sr went off and invented and patented rotary bits to do the job the equipment revolutionized the industry within five years his bits were being used in eleven states and thirteen foreign countries between 1908 and 1924 he obtained seventythree patents and became wealthy1 he is reported to have said about his drill bits we don’t have a monopoly people who want to drill for oil and not use the hughes bit can always use a pick and shovel who wants to be a millionaire when the senior hughes died his son became a millionaire he hired a management company to run the hughes tool company and then he thought about what he wanted to do with his life as a boy he had loved all kinds of machines he had built a radio and talked to ship captains when he was in his early teens and he had gotten a barnstormer to give him flying lessons secretly when he was fifteen he was intelligent and the whole world was open to him he decided to go into the moviemaking business after marrying a houston socialite he promptly moved to los angeles biography writer michael sauter says the impulsiveness of the move would become typical of hughes who repeatedly threw himself into expensively risky ventures like a boy obsessed with a new hobby2 soon hughes was producing movies and buying theaters in which to show them his work got little attention until he made an aviation movie called hell’s angels which he also directed he later went on to produce the front page and scarface both hits he was in a position to build a major studio and become a force in hollywood but by then he had lost his focus he seemed to be more interested in pursuing glamorous hollywood actresses than in making movies his wife divorced him in 1929 in the late 1920s he turned his attention to aviation he received a pilot’s license in 1928 and soon he was experimenting with aircraft design he started his own aircraft company in 1932 hughes aviation he’d buy a plane strip it down and redesign it for speed then he worked as his own test pilot for several years he set many of the world’s airspeed records for a decade he repeated the pattern of redesigning planes and pushing them to the limit from the cockpit then in 1940 when trans world airlines was in need of cash hughes was invited to invest in the company he didn’t just invest he bought a controlling interest at that time he decided he wanted to make air travel more popular so he engaged lockheed to build planes for twa according to his specifications the next year he opened a large aircraft manufacturing plant of his own in los angeles which supplied parts in support of the war in europe meanwhile hughes continued to dabble in the entertainment business producing and sometimes directing movies in september of 1942 hughes added another major activity to his agenda he was awarded a contract from the government to construct prototypes of flying boats he agreed to deliver the planes in 1944 for a cost of 18 million for the next several years he worked on developing the planes but by 1945 he still had not delivered any planes to the government despite having spent over 800 million including the construction of a huge hangar for 175 million3 his lack of focus not only prevented him from succeeding in that venture it also led to a mental breakdown one of three he experienced anything goes howard hughes went on to buy rko pictures several small airlines television stations and numerous hotels and casinos in las vegas no matter what got his attention he was able to do it thanks to hughes tool company which bankrolled his pursuits but nothing seemed to maintain his attention for long and nothing seemed to satisfy him he got married again in 1957 but he and his second wife drifted apart in 1966 he moved to las vegas without informing her and despite numerous attempts she was never able to see him again a few years later he left the country by then he was becoming more and more eccentric the rumor was that he lived like a hermit was phobic about germs and had succumbed to drug addiction in 1976 he died while being flown back to the united states for medical treatment there are those who would call hughes a success because of his wealth he was the nation’s first billionaire and at one time the wealthiest person in the world but when i read about hughes i see a broken life of unfulfilled potential he was unable to sustain any longterm relationships his marriages didn’t last he had no children and the only companies he owned that thrived are the ones he either never ran or eventually relinquished control of he transferred ownership of hughes aircraft to the nonprofit howard hughes medical institute in 1955 drove rko pictures into bankruptcy in 1958 and relinquished control of twa when it neared collapse in 1960 in 1971 he signed away control of the remainder of his empire he died alienated and alone why priorities matter today business consultant and author michael leboef says devoting a little of yourself to everything means committing a great deal of yourself to nothing that aptly describes the life of howard hughes focused concentration is one of the keys to success to have focus you must understand priorities here’s

diamonds discard them and their value will never be known improve them and they will become the brightest gems in a useful life we cannot change time only our priorities have you ever found yourself thinking i need more time well you’re not going to get it no one gets more time there are 1440 minutes in a day no matter what you do you won’t get more today sales consultant and author myers barnes says time management has nothing to do with the clock but everything to do with organizing and controlling your participation in certain events that coordinate with the clock einstein understood time management is an oxymoron it cannot be managed you can’t save time lose time turn back the hands of time or have more time tomorrow than today time is unemotional uncontrolled unencumbered it moves forward regardless of circumstances and in the game of life creates a level playing field for everyone5 since you can’t change time you must instead change your approach to it  since you can’t change time you must instead change your approach to it  we cannot do everything there was a time in my life when i thought i could do everything but i was very young energetic and naive chinese author and philosopher lin yutang said besides the noble art of getting things done there is the noble art of leaving things undone the wisdom of life consists of the elimination of nonessentials you can have anything you want but you cannot have everything you want you have to choose excellence comes from doing the right things right you’ve got to let go of the rest if you’re not sure what the right things are pretend you have only six months to live the things you would do in that short time are the right things we choose our life by how we spend time everything you now do is something you have chosen to do some people don’t want to believe that but if you’re over age twentyone your life is what you’re making of it to change your life you need to change your priorities jack welpott who ran the photography program at san francisco state university for many years was once asked how he was able to teach so effectively and create art so prolifically here was his answer from the day i was hired i began cultivating a reputation within the art department of being sort of a flake i found that after a year or so of losing track of my committee assignments forgetting to answer memos and missing departmental meetings—well after a while they just stopped asking me to do all those things welpott placed a higher priority on creating art and teaching others to do the same than he did on the politics and bureaucracy of university life you may not necessarily endorse the way he achieved his priorities but you have to agree that he knew what they were priorities help us to choose wisely author robert j mckain says the reason most goals are not achieved is that we spend our time doing second things first let’s face it there are a lot of things vying for your attention many people want to put you on their agenda thousands of manufacturers want you to spend your money on their products even your own desires can be so diverse and your attention so scattered that you often aren’t sure what should get your concentration that’s why you need to focus to be successful you can’t just run on the fast track run on your track people who reach their potential and fulfill their dreams determine and act on their priorities daily  to be successful you can’t just run on the fast track run on your track  making the decision to determine and act on important priorities daily when i first graduated from college and began my career i was not working according to my own agenda back in the 1960s when i studied for the ministry the majority of my course work had prepared me to do counseling and administration so when i began working in 1969 guess what i spent most of my time doing that’s right counseling and administration nothing could have been further from my natural gifts—or my natural inclinations despite much hard work i was neither fulfilled nor effective because i wanted to improve myself and pick up skills i didn’t learn in college in 1971 i began working on a business degree while reading for one of the courses i came across a paragraph written about italian economist vilfredo pareto it contained information about prioritizing called the pareto principle it said that by focusing your attention on the top 20 percent of all your priorities you would get an 80 percent return on your effort that was my eureka moment that’s when i made this decision i will prioritize my life and give focus and energy to those things that give the highest return i never looked at myself or my work the same again i realized that i needed to focus 80 percent of my time energy and resources on my areas of strength not on counseling and administration those activities were not bad things they were just bad things for me from the moment i made that decision i have been a practitioner of the pareto principle and i have taught it to others for thirtythree years if you want to read a more indepth treatment of the pareto principle read developing the leader within you most of the time this has kept me focused and on track although when i first began applying it the results sometimes didn’t work out the way i intended margaret and i still laugh about the time she asked me to start helping her mow the lawn margaret i said having just learned pareto i don’t want to waste time on something like that i’m trying to stay focused we can pay somebody to do that margaret looked at me and replied pay with what we worked it out but it was a defining moment for us from that time on i have tried to focus on those things that are important and not get sidetracked if you want to change the way you look at yourself and what you do by making a decision concerning your priorities then do the following take back today have you ever noticed that the people who have nothing to do usually want to spend their time with you poet carl sandburg said time is the most valuable coin in your life you and you alone will determine how that coin will be spent be careful that you do not let other people spend it for you your greatest possession is the twentyfour hours you have directly ahead of you how will you spend it will you give in to pressure or focus on priorities will you allow pointless emails unimportant tasks telemarketers interruptions and other distractions to consume your day or will you take complete responsibility for how you spend your time take control of the things you can and make today yours if you don’t decide how your day will be spent someone else will ask yourself three questions no daily dozen issue has added more to my success than the principle of priorities when i discovered that i needed to change my approach to my day and my career i started by asking myself three critical questions 1 what is required of me any realistic assessment of priorities in any area of life must start with a realistic assessment of what a person must do for you to be a good spouse or parent what is required of you to satisfy your employer what must you do if you lead others then the question should be what must you personally do that cannot be delegated to anyone else when ordering priorities always start with the requirement question and give it careful thought before moving on to the next question 2 what gives me the greatest return as you progress in your career you begin to discover that some activities yield a much higher return for the effort than others do anyone who hasn’t discovered that probably isn’t progressing in his career the next place to focus your attention is on those highreturn activities 3 what gives me the greatest reward if you do only what you must and what is effective you will be highly productive but you may not be content i think it’s also important to consider what gives you personal satisfaction however i find that some people want to start with the reward question and go no further than that no one can be successful who doesn’t possess the discipline to take care of the first two areas before adding the third philosopher william james said the art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook if you bring your priorities into focus by answering those three questions you will have a much better idea of what you should overlook  the art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook —william james  stay in your strength zone people don’t pay for average people don’t go looking for a mediocre restaurant and middling movie when they go out at night employers don’t award the contract to the salesman known as mr average nobody says let’s give the contract to the company that will do a merely adequate job it was a great day in my church when i stopped counseling people and stopped getting bogged down in administrative details but finding my strength zone took some time and exploration if you don’t already have a good handle on your strengths then you may want to explore some of these suggestions they’re based on what i did to find mine trial and error nothing teaches you more than your successes and failures any time something seems to be all trial and you make a lot of mistakes it’s probably time to move on but you’ve got to take the risk of failing to find your successes the counsel of others asking others to evaluate your effectiveness is not always fun but it is always helpful be sure to choose people who don’t have an agenda—other than to help you personality tests evaluations such as disc florence littauer’s personality profile and myersbriggs can be very helpful they will help to clarify some of your natural inclinations and help to reveal some strengths and weaknesses you aren’t aware of personal experience you really get a feel for how well you do something by doing it repeatedly just remember this experience isn’t always the best teacher—evaluated experience is british prime minister william gladstone said he is a wise man who wastes no energy on pursuits for which he is not fitted and he is wiser still who from among the things he can do well chooses and resolutely follows the best the more you stay in your strength zone the greater your productivity and the greater your ability to reach your potential  experience isn’t always the best teacher—evaluated experience is  managing the disciplines of priorities one of the things i noticed very quickly after making my priorities decision was that priorities shift very easily for that reason they must be continually evaluated and guarded my reminder to manage the disciplines of priorities is this every day i will live my life according to my priorities what does that mean five things 1 evaluate priorities daily a man went to the super bowl and climbed to the top row in the end zone section of the stadium to reach his seat after the game started he spotted an empty seat on the fiftyyard line after working his way down to it he asked the man in the next seat excuse me but is anyone sitting here no replied the man actually the seat belongs to me i was supposed to come with my wife but she died this is the first super bowl we haven’t been to together since we got married in 1967 that’s very sad but still couldn’t you find anyone else to take the seat—a relative or close friend no replied the man they’re all at the funeral priorities don’t stay put you have to revisit them every day why because conditions continually change so do methods of getting things done your values once defined are going to be steady you will be able to rely on them but how you carry them out needs to be flexible 2 plan your time carefully i once read that charles schwab president of bethlehem steel in the early twentieth century met with public relations and management consultant ivy lee because he wanted to improve his company’s productivity we know what we should be doing explained schwab now if you can show us a better way of getting it done i’ll listen to you—and pay you anything within reason lee said that he could help him and that it would take only twenty minutes of his time he handed schwab a blank sheet of paper and said write down the six most important things you have to do tomorrow schwab complied now number them in the order of their importance to you and the company when schwab had finished lee continued now put that paper in your pocket and first thing tomorrow morning take it out and look at item number one don’t look at the others just number one and start working on it and stay with it until it’s completed then take item number two the same way then number three and so on until you have to quit for the day don’t worry if you have finished only one or two you’ll be working on the most important ones the others you could not have finished with any other method and without some kind of system you’d probably take ten times as long to finish them—and might not even have them in the order of their importance do this every workday said lee after you’re convinced of the value of this system have your people try it out try it as long as you like and then send me a check for whatever you think the idea is worth in a few weeks schwab sent lee a check for 25000 along with a letter saying that it was the most profitable lesson he had ever learned not long after that bethlehem steel became the largest independent steel producer of its day according to a survey taken by daytimers inc only onethird of american workers plan their daily schedules and only 9 percent follow through and complete what they planned6 if you want to be effective you must be able to make the transition to planning i plan my calendar forty days at a time but when i get ready to approach a day i have the whole thing laid out hour by hour it’s a rare day that i get up in the morning wondering what i will be doing that day—even when on vacation 3 follow your plan i don’t mean to insult your intelligence by suggesting that you follow your plan but it needs to be said according to time management expert alec mackenzie surveys show that most executives don’t get to their most important tasks until midafternoon why most finished off lowpriority tasks so that they could have a sense of accomplishment7 german novelist johann wolfgang von goethe said things that matter most must never be at the mercy of things that matter least if you prioritize your life and plan your day but don’t follow through your results will be the same as those of someone who didn’t prioritize at all 4 delegate whenever possible i’ve observed that most people fall into one of two categories when it comes to delegation they’re either clingers or dumpers clingers refuse to let go of anything they think is important—whether they are the best person to do it or not their goal is perfection dumpers are quick to get rid of tasks yet give little thought to how successful their delegation efforts will be their goal is to get things off their desk how do you find the right standard for delegation when is it right to hand something off and when is it right to hold on to it here’s the guideline i use if someone else can do a task i’m doing 80 percent as well as i do then i hand it off that’s pretty darned good and if i do a good job of motivating encouraging and rewarding them then they will only get better i’ve handed off responsibilities using that standard and after a while the person who’s taken on the job has gone on to do it much better than i could when that happens it’s very rewarding today i am surrounded by people on my team who do things much better than i can they make up the difference in my weak areas and they exceed my expectations in others they lift me to a level higher than i could ever attain myself and they allow me to live out my priorities the advice of management expert peter drucker is true no executive has ever suffered because his subordinates were strong and effective  no executive has ever suffered because his subordinates were strong and effective —peter drucker  5 invest in the right people daily there’s one more area i want to address in the area of priorities and that’s the need to prioritize how we spend time with people my friend waylon moore has observed that often we spend priority time with problem people when we should be spending it with potential people i think that’s true how do you decide whom to spend time with certainly you want to treat everyone with respect and try to have a good positive relationship with everyone but you should not spend time with everyone equally here’s what i use to evaluate where to invest my time value to the team natural ability responsibility timing potential mentoring fit the person i currently most enjoy mentoring is kevin small the president of injoy one of my companies his talent is huge his potential is limitless no one impacts the team the way he does he is already one of the finest young executives in the country at age thirtytwo i can’t wait to see how he develops over the next decade reflecting on priorities i am grateful that i learned to prioritize my life early in my career no decision i’ve made has had as great an impact on my life and career here’s how in my 20s  my priorities took away the guilt of not doing everything in my 30s  my priorities helped me separate my strengths from my weaknesses in my 40s  my priorities gave me a high return on my work in my 50s  my priorities allow me to staff according to my weaknesses if you want to increase your focus and become effective on a level you’ve never experienced before then make a decision to prioritize your life and manage the discipline of priorities every day children are her priority any time people reach the highest level in their profession you can be sure that priorities have been very important to them that was certainly the case with betsy rogers a teacher in leeds alabama who became the 2003 national teacher of the year rogers can’t remember a time when she didn’t want to be a teacher it was in her blood—and in her family her grandmother taught in rural alabama beginning when she was only sixteen years old both her grandmother’s sisters followed her into the profession and rogers’s mother taught sunday school for fifty years so when she went off to college she naturally studied to become a teacher too i wanted to change the world for them says rogers it took me several years to realize i could not change the world in which my students lived but by understanding that school was the best place for some of my children i became committed to making my classroom a place where students feel safe as well as creating an environment that provides joy to those with unfortunate lives8 rogers began teaching in 1974 immediately after finishing her degree she took six years off to take care of her sons until they were school age but she knew that as soon as they were old enough she would be back in the classroom and being connected in the community where she would teach was a priority so in the early 1980s she and her husband bought an abandoned farm near her school rogers says when my husband and i moved our family from a more affluent neighborhood to leeds twentyone years ago our purpose was to raise our children in an environment with a more diverse population with a rural background  many of my colleagues do not believe it is beneficial to live in the community where you teach but i have found this relationship with the leeds community to be very rewarding and productive by living and working in leeds i truly became a stakeholder in the community9 by making that community connection a priority she has been better able to help her students she reaches out to parents has students over to her house and attends many of their extracurricular activities we should be very proud of our profession she says and we need to be models we shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that we have impact we may never see10 focused on improvement because rogers is focused she is constantly improving and working to reach her potential in her profession she believes that teachers must model a dedication to lifelong learning and she doesn’t just give lip service to it when both her sons were in college she went back to school herself she has since earned three graduate degrees—in 1998 2000 and 2002 as national teacher of the year she will be expected to spend a year visiting schools and serving as an international spokeswoman for education when she’s finished she could use the recognition she has received as a springboard to a plum teaching job or a higher paying administrative position but that’s not what she’s about according to county superintendent bob neighbors rogers has inquired about going back to work in a county school on academic alert because of poor test scores11 after all what’s the use of improving herself if she can’t use what she’s learned to help others neighbors calls rogers one of those extraordinary naturals for whom teaching is not only her vocation it is her joy her daily discovery and her avocation12 rogers sums it up this way i was taught that we are here on this earth to serve13 that’s her priority—and she is living it out every day  priorities application and exercisesdetermining and acting on important priorities daily your priorities decision today where do you stand when it comes to priorities today ask yourself these three questions  1 have i already made the decision to determine and act on important priorities daily 2 if so when did i make that decision 3 what exactly did i decide write it here    your priorities discipline every day based on the decision you made concerning priorities what is the one discipline you must practice today and every day in order to be successful write it here    making up for yesterday if you need some help making the right decision concerning attitude and developing the everyday discipline to live it out do the following exercises 1 how have you looked at time in the past have you seen it as a precious commodity or have you been lackadaisical about it how has your approach to time shaped your life so far 2 take a day off from work to really reflect on these questions in the chapter what is required of you what gives you the highest return what gives you the greatest reward how will your assessment in those three areas prompt you to change your life  3 practice a priority approach to going after a major goal that you currently have on your agenda using the following pattern prioritize know what is important organize decide how will it be done plan decide when you will do it communicate share your priorities with your team execute follow through on your plan evaluate examine yourself and your results in light of your priorities looking forward to tomorrow spend some time reflecting on how your decision concerning priorities and the daily discipline that comes out of it will positively impact you in the future what will be the compounding benefits write them here    keep what you’ve written as a constant reminder because   reflection today motivates your discipline every day and discipline every day maximizes your decision of yesterday  zen in the art of archery by eugen herrigel translated from the german by r f c hull first published 1953 preface in 1936 a lecture which i had delivered to the german−japanese society in berlin appeared in the magazine nippon under the title the chivalrous art of archery i had given this lecture with the utmost reserve for i had intended to show the close connection which exists between this art and zen and since this connection eludes precise description and real definition i was fully conscious of the provisional nature of my attempt in spite of everything my remarks aroused great interest they were translated into japanese in 1937 into dutch in 1938 and in 1939 i received news˙so far unconfirmed˙that an indian translation was being planned in 1940 a much improved japanese translation appeared together with an eyewitness account by prof sozo komachiya when curt weller who published the great liberation d t suzuki’s important book on zen and who is also bringing out a carefully planned series of buddhist writings asked me whether i agreed to a reprint of my lecture i willingly gave my consent but in the conviction of having made further spiritual progress during the past ten years˙and this means ten years of continual practice˙and of being able to say rather better than before with greater understanding and realization what this mystical art is about i have resolved to set down my experiences in new form unforgettable memories and notes which i made at the time in connection with the archery lessons stood me in good stead and so i can well say that there is no word in this exposition which the master would not have spoken no image or comparison which he would not have used i have also tried to keep my language as simple as possible not only because zen teaches and advocates the greatest economy of expression but because i have found that what i can not say quite simply and without recourse to mystic jargon has not become sufficiently clear and concrete even to myself to write a book on the essence of zen itself is one of my plans for the near future eugen herrigel zen in the art of archery i at first sight it must seem intolerably degrading for zen however the reader may understand this word to be associated with anything so mundane as archery even if he were willing to make a big concession and to find archery distinguished as an àrt’ he would scarcely feel inclined to look behind this art for anything more than a decidedly sporting form of prowess he therefore expects to be told something about the amazing feats of japanese trick−artists who have the advantage of being able to rely on a time− honoured and unbroken tradition in the use of bow and arrow for in the far east it is only a few generations since the old means of combat were replaced by modern weapons and familiarity in the handling of them by no means fell into disuse but went on propagating itself and has since been cultivated in ever widening circles might one not expect therefore a description of the special ways in which archery is pursued to−day as a national sport in japan nothing could be more mistaken than this expectation by archery in the traditional sense which he esteems as an art and honours as a national heritage the japanese does not understand a sport but strange as this may sound at first a religious ritual and consequently by the art of archery he does not mean the ability of the sportsman which can be controlled more or less by bodily exercises but an ability whose origin is to be sought in spiritual exercises and whose aim consists in hitting a spiritual goal so that fundamentally the marksman aims at himself and may even succeed in hitting himself this sounds puzzling no doubt what the reader will say are we to believe that archery once practised for the contest of life and death has not survived even as a sport but has been degraded to a spiritual exercise of what use then are the bow and arrow and target does not this deny the manly old art and honest meaning of archery and set up in its place something nebulous if not positively fantastic it must however be borne in mind that the peculiar spirit of this art far from having to be in fused back into the use of bow and arrow in recent times was always essentially bound up with them and has emerged all the more forthrightly and convincingly now that it no longer has to prove itself in bloody contests it is not true to say that the traditional technique of archery since it is no longer of importance in fighting has turned into a pleasant pastime and thereby been rendered innocuous the great doctrine of archery tells us something very different according to it archery is still a matter of life and death to the extent that it is a contest of the archer with himself and this kind of contest is not a paltry substitute but the foundation of all contests outwardly directed ˙ for instance with a bodily opponent in this contest of the archer with himself is revealed the secret essence of this art and instruction in it does not suppress anything essential by waiving the utilitarian ends to which the practice of knightly contests was put anyone who subscribes to this art to−day therefore will gain from its historical development the undeniable advantage of not being tempted to obscure his understanding of the great doctrine by practical aims ˙ even though he hides them from himself ˙ and to make it perhaps altogether impossible for access to the art ˙ and the master archers of all times are agreed in this ˙ is only granted to those who are pure in heart untroubled by subsidiary aims should one ask from this standpoint how the japanese masters understand this contest of the archer with himself and how they describe it their answer would sound enigmatic in the extreme for them the contest consists in the archer aiming at himself ˙ and yet not at himself in hitting himself ˙ and yet not himself and thus becoming simultaneously the aimer and the aim the hitter and the hit or to use some expressions which are nearest the heart of the masters it is necessary for the archer to become in spite of himself an unmoved centre then comes the supreme and ultimate miracle art becomes artless shooting becomes not−shooting a shooting without bow and arrow the teacher becomes a pupil again the master a beginner the end a beginning and the beginning perfection for orientals these mysterious formulae are clear and familiar truths but for us they are completely bewildering we have therefore to go into this question more deeply for some considerable time it has been no secret even to us europeans that the japanese arts go back for their inner form to a common root namely buddhism this is as true of the art of archery as of ink painting of the art of the theatre no less than the tea ceremony the art of flower arrangement and swordsmanship all of them presuppose a spiritual attitude and each cultivates it in its own way ˙ an attitude which in its most exalted form is characteristic of buddhism and determines the nature of the priestly type of man i do not mean buddhism in the ordinary sense nor am i concerned here with the decidedly speculative form of buddhism which because of its allegedly accessible literature is the only one we know in europe and even claim to understand i mean dhyana buddhism which is known in japan as zen and is not speculation at all but immediate experience of what as the bottomless ground of being cannot be apprehended by intellectual means and cannot be conceived or interpreted even after the most unequivocal and incontestable experiences one knows it by not knowing it for the sake of those crucial experiences zen buddhism has struck out on paths which through methodical immersion in oneself lead to one’s becoming aware in the deepest ground of the soul of the unnamable groundlessness and qualitylessness˙nay more to one’s becoming one with it and this with respect to archery and expressed in very tentative and on that account possibly misleading language means that the spiritual exercises thanks to which alone the technique of archery becomes an art and if all goes well perfects itself as the artless art are mystical exercises and accordingly archery can in no circumstances mean accomplishing anything outwardly with bow and arrow but only inwardly with oneself bow and arrow are only a pretext for something that could just as well happen without them only the way to a goal not the goal itself only helps for the last decisive leap in view of all this nothing would be more desirable than that one should be able to lay hands on expositions by zen buddhists as an aid to understanding these are in fact not lacking in his essays in zen buddhism d t suzuki has succeeded in showing that japanese culture and zen are intimately connected and that japanese art the spiritual attitude of the samurai the japanese way of life the moral aesthetic and to a certain extent even the intellectual life of the japanese owe their peculiarities to this background of zen and cannot be properly understood by anybody not acquainted with it the exceedingly important work of suzuki and the researches of other japanese scholars have aroused widespread interest it is generally admitted that dhyana buddhism which was born in india and after undergoing profound changes reached full development in china to be finally adopted by japan where it is cultivated as a living tradition to this day has disclosed unsuspected ways of existence which it is of the utmost importance for us to understand despite all the efforts of zen experts however the insight afforded to us europeans into the essence of zen has remained exceedingly scanty as though it resisted deeper penetration after a few steps one’s groping intuition comes up against insurmountable barriers wrapped in impenetrable darkness zen must seem the strangest riddle which the spiritual life of the east has ever devised insoluble and yet irresistibly attractive the reason for this painful feeling of inaccessibility lies to some extent in the style of exposition that has hitherto been adopted for zen no reasonable person would expect a zen adept to do more than hint at the experiences which have liberated and changed him or to attempt to describe the unimaginable and ineffable truth by which he now lives in this respect zen is akin to pure introspective mysticism unless we enter into mystic experiences by direct participation we remain outside turn and twist as we may this law which all genuine mysticism obeys allows of no exceptions it is no contradiction that there exists a plethora of zen texts regarded as sacred they have the peculiarity of disclosing their life−giving meaning only to those who have shown themselves worthy of the crucial experiences and who can therefore extract from these texts confirmation of what they themselves already possess and are independently of them to the inexperienced on the other hand they remain not only dumb ˙ how could he ever be in a position to read between the lines ˙ but will infallibly lead him into the most hopeless spiritual confusion even if he approaches them with wariness and selfless devotion like all mysticism zen can only be understood by one who is himself a mystic and is therefore not tempted to gain by underhand methods what the mystical experience withholds from him yet the man who is transformed by zen and who has passed through the fire of truth leads far too convincing a life for it to be overlooked so it is not asking too much if driven by a feeling of spiritual affinity and desirous of finding a way to the nameless power which can work such miracles ˙ for the merely curious have no right to demand anything ˙ we expect the zen adept at least to describe the way that leads to the goal no mystic and no student of zen is at first step the man he can become through self−perfection how much has still to be conquered and left behind before he finally lights upon the truth how often is he tormented on the way by the desolate feeling that he is attempting the impossible and yet this impossible will one day have become possible and even self−evident is there not room for the hope then that a careful description of this long and difficult road will allow us at least one thing to ask whether we wish to travel it such descriptions of the way and its stations are almost entirely lacking in zen literature this is partly due to the fact that the zen adept has an insuperable objection to giving any kind of instructions for the happy life he knows from personal experience that nobody can stay the course without conscientious guidance from a skilled teacher and without the help of a master no less decisive on the other hand is the fact that his experiences his conquests and spiritual transformations so long as they still remain his must be conquered and transformed again and again until everything his is annihilated only in this way can he attain a basis for experiences which as the all−embracing truth rouse him to a life that is no longer his everyday personal life he lives but what lives is no longer himself from this standpoint we can understand why the zen adept shuns all talk of himself and his progress not because he thinks it immodest to talk but because he regards it as a betrayal of zen even to make up his mind to say anything about zen itself costs him grave heart−searchings he has before him the warning example of one of the greatest masters who on being asked what zen was maintained an unmoving silence as though he had not heard the question how then could any adept feel tempted to render an account of what he has thrown away and no longer misses in these circumstances i should be shirking my responsibilities if i confined myself to a string of paradoxes and took refuge behind a barrage of high−sounding words for it was my intention to throw light on the nature of zen as it affects one of the arts upon which it has set its stamp this light is certainly not illumination in the sense fundamental to zen but at least shows that there must be something behind the impenetrable walls of mist and which like summer lightning heralds the distant storm so understood the art of archery is rather like a preparatory school for zen for it enables the beginner to gain a clearer view through the works of his own hands of events which are not in themselves intelligible objectively speaking it would be entirely possible to make one’s way to zen from any one of the arts i have named however i think i can achieve my aim most effectively by describing the course which a pupil of the art of archery has to complete to be more precise i shall try to summarize the six−year course of instruction i received from one of the greatest masters of this art during my stay in japan so it is my own experiences which authorize me in this undertaking in order to make myself intelligible at all ˙ for even this preparatory school holds riddles enough ˙ i have no alternative but to recollect in detail all the resistances i had to overcome all the inhibitions i had to fight down before i succeeded in penetrating into the spirit of the great doctrine i speak about myself only because i see no other way of reaching the goal i have set before me for the same reason i shall confine my account to essentials so as to make them stand out more clearly i consciously refrain from describing the setting in which the instruction took place from conjuring up scenes that have fixed themselves in my memory and above all from sketching a picture of the master ˙ however tempting all this may be everything must hinge on the art of archery which i sometimes feel is even more difficult to expound than to learn and the exposition must be carried to the point where we begin to discern those far−off horizons behind which zen lives and breathes ii why i took up zen and for this purpose set out to learn the art of archery needs some explanation even as a student i had as though driven by a secret urge been preoccupied with mysticism despite the mood of the times which had little use for such interests for all my exertions however i became increasingly aware that i could only approach these esoteric writings from the outside and though i knew how to circle around what one may call the primordial mystic phenomenon i was unable to leap over the line which surrounded the mystery like a high wall nor could i find exactly what i sought in the extensive literature of mysticism and disappointed and discouraged i gradually came to realize that only the truly detached can understand what is meant by detachment and that only the contemplative who is completely empty and rid of the self is ready to become one with the transcendent deity  i had realized therefore that there is and can be no other way to mysticism than the way of personal experience and suffering and that if this premise is lacking all talk about it is so much empty chatter but˙how does one become a mystic how attain the state of real and not just imaginary detachment is there still a way to it even for those who are separated by the abyss of the centuries from the great masters for the modern man who has grown up under totally different conditions nowhere did i find anything approaching satisfactory answers to my questions even though i was told about the stages and stations of a way that promised to lead to the goal to tread this way i lacked the precise methodical in structions which might substitute for a master at least for part of the journey but would such instructions even if there were any suffice is it not more probable that at best they only create a readiness to receive something which even the best method cannot provide and that the mystical experience therefore cannot be induced by any disposition known to man however i looked at it i found myself confronted by locked doors and yet i could not refrain from constantly rattling at the handles but the longing persisted and when it grew weary the longing for this longing when therefore i was asked ˙ i had in the meantime become a lecturer at a university˙ whether i would like to teach philosophy at the university of tokyo i welcomed this opportunity of getting to know the country and people of japan with especial joy if only because it held out the prospect of my making contact with buddhism and hence with an introspective practice of mysticism for this much i had already heard that there was in japan a carefully guarded and living tradition of zen an art of instruction that had been tested over the centuries and most important of all teachers of zen astonishingly well versed in the art of spiritual guidance scarcely had i begun to find my way about in the new milieu when i set out to realize my desire i at once met with embarrassed refusals never yet i was told had any european seriously concerned himself with zen and since zen repudiated the least trace of teaching it was not to be expected that it would satisfy me theoretically it cost me many wasted hours before i succeeded in making them understand why i wished to devote myself specifically to the non−speculative form of zen thereupon i was informed that it was quite hopeless for a european to attempt to penetrate into this realm of spiritual life ˙ perhaps the strangest which the far east has to offer ˙ unless he began by learning one of the japanese arts associated with zen the thought of having to go through a kind of preparatory schooling did not deter me i felt ready to go to any length if only there were some hope of my getting a bit nearer to zen and a roundabout way however wearisome seemed better to me than no way at all but to which of the arts named for this purpose should i subscribe my wife after a little hesitation decided for flower arrangement and painting while the art of archery seemed more suitable for me on the ˙ as it later turned out ˙ completely erroneous assumption that my experiences in rifle and pistol shooting would be to my advantage i begged one of my colleagues sozo komachiya a professor of jurisprudence who had been taking lessons in archery for twenty years and who was rightly regarded as the best exponent of this art at the university to enter my name as a pupil with his former teacher the celebrated master kenzo awa the master at first refused my request saying that he had once been misguided enough to instruct a foreigner and had regretted the experience ever since he was not prepared to make concessions a second time in order to spare the pupil the burden of the peculiar spirit of this art only when i protested that a master who took his job so seriously could well treat me as his youngest pupil seeing that i wished to learn this art not for pleasure but for the sake of the great doctrine did he accept me as his pupil together with my wife since it has long been customary in japan for girls to be instructed in this art and since the master’s wife and two daughters were diligent practitioners and so began the long and strenuous course of instruction in which our friend mr komachiya who pleaded our cause so obstinately and almost stood guarantor for us participated as interpreter at the same time my good fortune in being invited to attend my wife’s lessons in flower arrangement and painting held out the prospect of my winning a still broader basis of understanding through constant comparison of these mutually complementary arts iii that the way of the artless art is not easy to follow we were to learn during the very first lesson the master began by showing us various japanese bows explaining that their extraordinary elasticity was due to their peculiar construction and also to the material from which they are generally made namely bamboo but it seemed even more important to him that we should note the noble form which the bow˙it is over six feet long˙ assumes as soon as it is strung and which appears the more surprising the further the bow is drawn when drawn to its full extent the bow encloses the all in itself explained the master and that is why it is important to learn how to draw it properly then he grasped the best and strongest of his bows and standing in a ceremonious and dignified attitude let the lightly drawn bowstring fly back several times this produces a sharp crack mingled with a deep thrumming which one never afterwards forgets when one has heard it only a few times so strange is it so thrillingly does it grip the heart from ancient times it has been credited with the secret power of banishing evil spirits and i can well believe that this interpretation has struck root in the whole japanese people after this significant introductory act of purification and consecration the master commanded us to watch him closely he placed or nocked an arrow on the string drew the bow so far that i was afraid it would not stand up to the strain of embracing the all and loosed the arrow all this looked not only very beautiful but quite effortless he then gave us his instructions now you do the same but remember that archery is not meant to strengthen the muscles when drawing the string you should not exert the full strength of your body but must learn to let only your two hands do the work while your arm and shoulder muscles remain relaxed as though they looked on impassively only when you can do this will you have fulfilled one of the conditions that make the drawing and the shooting ˆspiritual˜ with these words he gripped my hands and slowly guided them through the phases of the movement which they would have to execute in the future as if accustoming me to the feel of it even at the first attempt with a medium−strong practicebow i noticed that i had to use considerable force to bend it this is because the japanese bow unlike the european sporting bow is not held at shoulder level in which position you can as it were press yourself into it rather as soon as the arrow is nocked the bow is held up with arms at nearly full stretch so that the archer’s hands are somewhere above his head consequently the only thing he can do is to pull them evenly apart to left and right and the further apart they get the more they curve downwards until the left hand which holds the bow comes to rest at eye level with the arm outstretched while the right hand which draws the string is held with arm bent above the right shoulder so that the tip of the three−foot arrow sticks out a little beyond the outer edge of the bow ˙so great is the span in this attitude the archer has to remain for a while before loosing the shot the strength needed for this unusual method of holding and drawing the bow caused my hands to start trembling after a few moments and my breathing became more and more laboured nor did this get any better during the weeks that followed the drawing continued to be a difficult business and despite the most diligent practice refused to becomespiritual to comfort myself i hit upon the thought that there must be a trick somewhere which the master for some reason would not divulge and i staked my ambition on its discovery grimly set on my purpose i continued practising the master followed my efforts attentively quietly corrected my strained attitude praised my enthusiasm reproved me for wasting my strength but otherwise let me be only he always touched on a sore spot when as i was drawing the bow he called out to me to relax relax ˙a word he had learned in the meantime˙ though he never lost his patience and politeness but the day came when it was i who lost patience and brought myself to admit that i absolutely could not draw the bow in the manner prescribed  you cannot do it explained the master `because you do not breathe right press your breath down gently after breathing in so that the abdominal wall is tightly stretched and hold it there for a while then breathe out as slowly and evenly as possible and after a short pause draw a quick breath of air again − out and in continually in a rhythm that will gradually settle itself if it is done properly you will feel the shooting becoming easier every day for through this breathing you will not only discover the source of all spiritual strength but will also cause this source to flow more abundantly and to pour more easily through your limbs the more relaxed you are and as if to prove it he drew his strong bow and invited me to step behind him and feel his arm muscles they were indeed quite relaxed as though they were doing no work at all the new way of breathing was practised without bow and arrow at first until it came naturally the slight feeling of discomfort noticeable in the beginning was quickly overcome the master attached so much importance to breathing out as slowly and steadily as possible to the very end that for better practice and control he made us combine it with a humming note only when the note had died away with the last expiring breath were we allowed to draw air again the breathing in the master once said binds and combines by holding your breath you make everything go right and the breathing out loosens and completes by overcoming all limitations but we could not understand that yet the master now went on to relate the breathing which had not of course been practised for its own sake to archery the unified process of drawing and shooting was divided into sections grasping the bow nocking the arrow raising the bow drawing and remaining at the point of highest tension loosing the shot each of them began with breathing in was sustained by firm holding of the down−pressed breath and ended with breathing out the result was that the breathing fell into place spontaneously and not only accentuated the individual positions and hand−movements but wove them together in a rhythmical sequence depending for each of us on the state of his breathing capacity in spite of its being divided into parts the entire process seemed like a living thing wholly contained in itself and not even remotely comparable to a gymnastic exercise to which bits can be added or taken away without its meaning and character being thereby destroyed i cannot think back to those days without recalling over and over again how difficult i found it in the beginning to get my breathing to work out right though i breathed in technically the right way whenever i tried to keep my arm and shoulder muscles relaxed while drawing the bow the muscles of my legs stiffened all the more violently as though my life depended on a firm foothold and secure stance and as though like antaeus i had to draw strength from the ground often the master had no alternative but to pounce quick as lightning on one of my leg muscles and press it in a particularly sensitive spot when to excuse myself i once remarked that i was conscientiously making an effort to keep relaxed he replied that’s just the trouble you make an effort to think about it concentrate entirely on your breathing as if you had nothing else to do  it took me a considerable time before i succeeded in doing what the master wanted but ˙ i succeeded i learned to lose myself so effortlessly in the breathing that i sometimes had the feeling that i myself was not breathing but ˙ strange as this may sound ˙was being breathed and even when in hours of thoughtful reflection i struggled against this bold idea i could no longer doubt that the breathing held out all that the master had promised now and then and in the course of time more and more frequently i managed to draw the bow and keep it drawn until the moment of release while remaining completely relaxed in body without my being able to say how it happened the qualitative difference between these few successful shots and the innumerable failures was so convincing that i was ready to admit that now at last i understood what was meant by drawing the bow spiritually  so that was it not a technical trick i had tried in vain to pick up but liberating breath−control with new and far−reaching possibilities i say this not without misgivings for i well know how great is the temptation to succumb to a powerful influence and ensnared in self−delusion to overrate the importance of an experience merely because it is so unusual but despite all equivocation and sober reserve the results obtained by the new breathing ˙ for in time i was able to draw even the strong bow of the master with muscles relaxed˙were far too definite to be denied in talking it over with mr komachiya i once asked him why the master had looked on so long at my futile efforts to draw the bow spiritually why he had not insisted on the correct breathing right from the the start a great master he replied  must also be a great teacher with us the two things go hand in hand had he begun the lessons with breathing exercises he would never have been able to convince you that you owe them anything decisive you had to suffer shipwreck through your own efforts before you were ready to seize the lifebelt he threw you believe me i know from my own experience that the master knows you and each of his pupils much better than we know ourselves he reads in the souls of his pupils more than they care to admit  iv to be able to draw the bow spiritually after a year that is with a kind of effortless strength is no very startling achievement and yet i was well content for i had begun to understand why the system of selfdefence whereby one brings one’s opponent to the ground unexpectedly giving way with effortless resilience to his passionately delivered attack thus turning his own strength against him is known as the gentle art  since the remotest times its symbol has been the yielding and yet unconquerable water so that lao−tzu could say with profound truth that right living is like water which of all things the most yielding can overwhelm that which is of all things most hard moreover the saying of the master went round in school that whoever makes good progress in the beginning has all the more difficulties later on for me the beginning had been far from easy was i not entitled therefore to feel confident in the face of what was to come and the difficulties of which i was already beginning to suspect the next thing to be learned was the loosing of the arrow up to now we had been allowed to do this haphazard it stood in parenthesis as it were on the margin of the exercises and what happened to the arrow was even more a matter of indifference so long as it pierced the roll of pressed straw which served the double purpose of target and sandbank honour was deemed to have been satisfied to hit it was no great feat since we were only ten paces away from it at most hitherto i had simply let go of the bowstring when the hold at the point of highest tension had become unendurable when i felt i had to give way if my parted hands were not forcibly to be pulled together again the tension is not in any sense painful a leather glove with a stiffened and thickly padded thumb guards against the pressure of the string becoming uncomfortable and prematurely shortening the hold at the point of highest tension when drawing the thumb is wrapped round the bowstring immediately below the arrow and tucked in the first three fingers are gripped over it firmly and at the same time give the arrow a secure hold loosing therefore means opening the fingers that grip the thumb and setting it free through the tremendous pull of the string the thumb is wrenched from its position stretched out the string whirrs and the arrow flies when i had loosed hitherto the shot had never gone off without a powerful jerk which made itself felt in a visible shaking of my whole body and affected the bow and arrow as well that there could be no possibility of a smooth and above all certain shot goes without saying it was bound to wobble  all that you have learned hitherto said the master one day when he found nothing more to object to in my relaxed manner of drawing the bow was only a preparation for loosing the shot we are now faced with a new and particularly difficult task which brings us to a new stage in the art of archery  so saying the master gripped his bow drew it and shot only now when expressly watching out for it did i observe that though the right hand of the master suddenly opened and released by the tension flew back with a jerk it did not cause the least shaking of the body the right arm which before the shot had formed an acute angle was jerked open but ran gently back into full extension the unavoidable jerk had been cushioned and neutralized if the force of the discharge did not betray itself in the sharp  thup of the quivering bowstring and in the penetrative power of the arrow one would never suspect its existence at least in the case of the master the loose looked so simple and undemanding that it might have been child’s play the effortlessness of a performance for which great strength is needed is a spectacle of whose aesthetic beauty the east has an exceedingly sensitive and grateful appreciation but ever more important to me˙and at that stage i could hardly think otherwise˙was the fact that the certainty of hitting seemed to depend on the shot’s being smoothly loosed i knew from rifle−shooting what a difference it makes to jerk away if only slightly from the line of sight all that i had learned and achieved so far only became intelligible to me from this point of view relaxed drawing of the bow relaxed holding at the point of highest tension relaxed loosing of the shot relaxed cushioning of the recoil˙did not all this serve the grand purpose of hitting the target and was not this the reason why we were learning archery with so much trouble and patience why then had the master spoken as if the process we were now concerned with far exceeded everything we had practised and accustomed ourselves to up ’til now however that may be i went on practising diligently and conscientiously according to the master’s instructions and yet all my efforts were in vain often it seemed to me that i had shot better before when i loosed the shot at random without thinking about it above all i noticed that i could not open the right hand and particularly the fingers gripping the thumb without exertion the result was a jerk at the moment of release so that the arrow wobbled still less was i capable of cushioning the suddenly freed hand the master continued undeterred to demonstrate the correct loose undeterred i sought to do like him ˙ with the sole result that i grew more uncertain than ever i seemed like the centipede which was unable to stir from the spot after trying to puzzle out in what order its feet ought to go the master was evidently less horrified by my failure than i myself did he know from experience that it would come to this don’t think of what you have to do don’t consider how to carry it out he exclaimed `the shot will only go smoothly when it takes the archer himself by surprise it must be as if the bowstring suddenly cut through the thumb that held it you mustn’t open the right hand on purpose there followed weeks and months of fruitless practice i could take my standard again and again from the way the master shot see with my own eyes the nature of the correct loose but not a single one succeeded if waiting in vain for the shot i gave way to the tension because it began to be unendurable then my hands were slowly pulled together and the shot came to nothing if i grimly resisted the tension `til i was gasping for breath i could only do so by calling on the arm and shoulder muscles for aid i then stood there immobilized˙like a statue mocked the master ˙ but tense and my relaxedness was gone perhaps it was chance perhaps it was deliberately arranged by the master that we one day found ourselves together over a cup of tea i seized on this opportunity for a discussion and poured my heart out  i understand well enough i said that the hand mustn’t be opened with a jerk if the shot is not to be spoiled but however i set about it it always goes wrong if i clench my hand as tightly as possible i can’t stop it shaking when i open my fingers if on the other hand i try to keep it relaxed the bowstring is torn from my grasp before the full stretch is reached˙unexpectedly it is true but still too early i am caught between these two kinds of failure and see no way of escape  you must hold the drawn bowstring answered the master like a little child holding the proffered finger it grips it so firmly that one marvels at the strength of the tiny fist and when it lets the finger go there is not the slightest jerk do you know why because a child doesn’t think i will now let go of the finger in order to grasp this other thing completely un−selfconsciously without purpose it turns from one to the other and we would say that it was playing with the things were it not equally true that the things are playing with the child  maybe i understand what you are hinting at with this comparison i remarked but am i not in an entirely different situation when i have drawn the bow the moment comes when i feel unless the shot comes at once i shan’t be able to endure the tension and what happens then merely that i get out of breath so i must loose the shot whether i want to or not because i can’t wait for it any longer  you have described only too well  replied the master  where the difficulty lies do you know why you cannot wait for the shot and why you get out of breath before it has come the right shot at the right moment does not come because you do not let go of yourself you do not wait for fulfilment but brace yourself for failure so long as that is so you have no choice but to call forth some thing yourself that ought to happen independently of you and so long as you call it forth your hand will not open in the right way ˙ like the hand of a child it does not burst open like the skin of a ripe fruit  i had to admit to the master that this interpretation made me more confused than ever for ultimately i said i draw the bow and loose the shot in order to hit the target the drawing is thus a means to an end and i cannot lose sight of this connection the child knows nothing of this but for me the two things cannot be disconnected  the right art cried the master ìs purposeless aimless the more obstinately you try to learn how to shoot the arrow for the sake of hitting the goal the less you will succeed in the one and the further the other will recede what stands in your way is that you have a much too wilful will you think that what you do not do yourself does not happen  but you yourself have told me often enough that archery is not a pastime not a purposeless game but a matter of life and death  i stand by that we master archers say one shot˙one life what this means you cannot yet understand but perhaps another image will help you which expresses the same experience we master archers say with the upper end of the bow the archer pierces the sky on the lower end as though attached by a thread hangs the earth if the shot is loosed with a jerk there is a danger of the thread snapping for purposeful and violent people the rift becomes final and they are left in the awful centre between heaven and earth  what must i do then i asked thoughtfully  you must learn to wait properly  and how does one learn that  by letting go of yourself leaving yourself and everything yours behind you so decisively that nothing more is left of you but a purposeless tension  so i must become purposeless˙on purpose i heard myself say  no pupil has ever asked me that so i don’t know the right answer  and when do we begin these new exercises  wait until it is time  v this conversation˙the first intimate talk i had had since the beginning of my instruction˙puzzled me exceedingly now at last we had touched on the theme for whose sake i had undertaken to learn archery was not this letting go of oneself of which the master had spoken a stage on the way to emptiness and detachment had i not reached the point where the influence of zen on the art of archery began to make itself felt what the relation might be between the purposeless waiting−capacity and the loosing of the shot at the right moment when the tension spontaneously fulfilled itself i could not at present fathom but why try to anticipate in thought what only experience can teach was it not high time to drop this unfruitful habit how often i had silently envied all those pupils of the master who like children let him take them by the hand and lead them how delightful it must be to be able to do this without reserve such an attitude need not necessarily lead to indifference and spiritual stagnation might not children at least ask questions during the next lesson the master ˙ to my disappointment ˙ went on with the previous exercises drawing holding and loosing but all this encouragement availed nothing although i tried in accordance with his instructions not to give way to the tension but to struggle beyond it as though no limits were set by the nature of the bow although i strove to wait until the tension simultaneously fulfilled and loosed itself in the shot ˙ despite all my efforts every shot miscarried bewitched botched wobbling only when it be came clear that it was not only pointless to continue these exercises but positively dangerous since i was oppressed more and more by a premonition of failure did the master break off and begin on a completely new tack  when you come to the lessons in the future he warned us  you must collect yourselves on your way here focus your minds on what happens in the practice−hall walk past everything without noticing it as if there were only one thing in the world that is important and real and that is archery  the process of letting go of oneself was likewise divided into separate sections which had to be worked through carefully and here too the master contented himself with brief hints for the performance of these exercises it is sufficient that the pupil should understand or in some cases merely guess what is demanded of him hence there is no need to conceptualize the distinctions which are traditionally expressed in images and who knows whether these images born of centuries of practice may not go deeper than all our carefully calculated knowledge the first step along this road had already been taken it had led to a loosening of the body without which the bow cannot be properly drawn if the shot is to be loosed right the physical loosening must now be continual in a mental and spiritual loosening so as to make the mind not only agile but free agile because of its freedom and free be cause of its original agility and this original agility is essentially different from everything that is usually understood by mental agility thus between these two states of bodily relaxedness on the one hand and spiritual freedom on the other there is a difference of level which cannot be overcome by breath−control alone but only by withdrawing from all attachments whatsoever by becoming utterly egoless so that the soul sunk within itself stands in the plenitude of its nameless origin the demand that the door of the senses be closed is not met by turning energetically away from the sensible world but rather by a readiness to yield without resistance in order that this actionless activity may be accomplished instinctively the soul needs an inner hold and it wins it by concentrating on breathing this is performed consciously and with a conscientiousness that borders on the pedantic the breathing in like the breathing out is practised again and again by itself with the utmost care one does not have to wait long for results the more one concentrates on breathing the more the external stimuli fade into the background they sink away in a kind of muffled roar which one hears with only half an ear at first and in the end one finds it no more disturbing than the distant roar of the sea which once one has grown accustomed to it is no longer perceived in due course one even grows immune to larger stimuli and at the same time detachment from them becomes easier and quicker care has only to be taken that the body is relaxed whether standing sitting or lying and if one then concentrates on breathing one soon feels oneself shut in by impermeable layers of silence one only knows and feels that one breathes and to detach oneself from this feeling and knowing no fresh decision is required for the breathing slows down of its own accord becomes more and more economical in the use of breath and finally slipping by degrees into a blurred monotone escapes one’s attention altogether this exquisite state of unconcerned immersion in oneself is not unfortunately of long duration it is liable to be disturbed from inside as though sprung from nowhere moods feelings desires worries and even thoughts incontinently rise up in a meaningless jumble and the more far−fetched and preposterous they are and the less they have to do with that on which one has fixed one’s consciousness the more tenaciously they hang on it is as though they wanted to avenge themselves on consciousness for having through concentration touched upon realms it would otherwise never reach the only successful way of rendering this disturbance inoperative is to keep on breathing quietly and unconcernedly to enter into friendly relations with whatever appears on the scene to accustom oneself to it to look at it equably and at last grow weary of looking in this way one gradually gets into a state which resembles the melting drowsiness on the verge of sleep to slip into it finally is the danger that has to be avoided it is met by a peculiar leap of concentration comparable perhaps to the jolt which a man who has stayed up all night gives himself when he knows that his life depends on all his senses being alert and if this leap has been successful but a single time it can be repeated with certainty with its help the soul is brought to the point where it vibrates of itself in itself˙a serene pulsation which can be heightened into the feeling otherwise experienced only in rare dreams of extraordinary lightness and the rapturous certainty of being able to summon up energies in any direction to intensify or to release tensions graded to a nicety this state in which nothing definite is thought planned striven for desired or expected which aims in no particular direction and yet knows itself capable alike of the possible and the impossible so unswerving is its power˙this state which is at bottom purposeless and egoless was called by the master truly spiritual it is in fact charged with spiritual awareness and is therefore also called right presence of mind this means that the mind or spirit is present everywhere because it is nowhere attached to any particular place and it can remain present because even when related to this or that object it does not cling to it by reflection and thus lose its original mobility like water filling a pond which is always ready to flow off again it can work its inexhaustible power because it is free and be open to everything because it is empty this state is essentially a primordial state and its symbol the empty circle is not empty of meaning for him who stands within it out of the fullness of this presence of mind disturbed by no ulterior motive the artist who is released from all attachment must practise his art but if he is to fit himself self−effacingly into the creative process the practice of the art must have the way smoothed for it for if in his self−immersion he saw himself faced with a situation into which he could not leap instinctively he would first have to bring it to consciousness he would then enter again into all the relationships from which he had detached himself he would be like one wakened who considers his programme for the day but not like an awakened one who lives and works in the primordial state it would never appear to him as if the individual parts of the creative process were being played into his hands by a higher power he would never experience how intoxicatingly the vibrancy of an event is communicated to him who is himself only a vibration and how everything that he does is done before he knows it the necessary detachment and self−liberation the inward−turning and intensification of life until full presence of mind is reached are therefore not left to chance or to favourable conditions the less so as the more depends on them and least of all are they abandoned to the process of creation itself ˙ which already demands all the artist’s powers ˙ in the hope that the desired concentration will appear of its own accord before all doing and creating before ever he begins to devote and adjust himself to his task the artist summons forth this presence of mind and makes sure of it through practice but from the time he succeeds in capturing it not merely at rare intervals but in having it at his finger tips in a few moments the concentration like the breathing is brought into connection with archery in order to slip the more easily into the process of drawing the bow and loosing the shot the archer kneeling to one side and beginning to concentrate rises to his feet ceremoniously steps up to the target and with a deep obeisance offers the bow and arrow like consecrated gifts then nocks the arrow raises the bow draws it and waits in an attitude of supreme spiritual alertness after the lightning release of the arrow and the tension the archer remains in the posture adopted immediately following the shot until after slowly expelling his breath he is forced to draw air again then only does he let his arms sink bows to the target and if he has no more shots to discharge steps quietly into the background archery thus becomes a ceremony which exemplifies the  great doctrine  even if the pupil does not at this stage grasp the true significance of his shots he at least understands why archery cannot be a sport a gymnastic exercise he understands why the technically learnable part of it must be practised to the point of repletion if everything depends on the archer’s becoming purposeless and effacing himself in the event then its outward realization must occur automatically in no further need of the controlling or reflecting intelligence vi it is this mastery of form that the japanese method of instruction seeks to inculcate practice repetition and repetition of the repeated with ever increasing intensity are its distinctive features for long stretches of the way at least this is true of all the traditional arts demonstration example intuition imitation that is the fundamental relationship of instructor to pupil although with the introduction of new educational subjects during the last few decades european methods of instruction have also gained a foothold and been applied with undeniable understanding how is it that in spite of the initial enthusiasm for everything new the japanese arts have remained in essence untouched by these educational reforms it is not easy to give an answer to this question yet the attempt must be made even if only sketchily with a view to throwing more light on the style of instruction and the meaning of imitation the japanese pupil brings with him three things good education passionate love for his chosen art and uncritical veneration of his teacher the teacher−pupil relationship has belonged since ancient times to the basic commitments of life and therefore presupposes on the part of the teacher a high responsibility which goes far beyond the scope of his professional duties nothing more is required of the pupil at first than that he should conscientiously copy what the teacher shows him shunning long−winded instructions and explanations the latter contents himself with perfunctory commands and does not reckon on any questions from the pupil impassively he looks on at the blundering efforts not even hoping for independence or initiative and waits patiently for growth and ripeness both have time the teacher does not harass and the pupil does not overtax himself far from wishing to waken the artist in the pupil prematurely the teacher considers it his first task to make him a skilled artisan with sovereign control of his craft the pupil follows out this intention with untiring industry as though he had no higher aspirations he bows under his burden with a kind of obtuse devotion only to discover in the course of years that forms which he perfectly masters no longer oppress but liberate he grows daily more capable of following any inspiration without technical effort and also of letting inspiration come to him through meticulous observation the hand that guides the brush has already caught and executed what floated before the mind at the same moment as the mind began to form it and in the end the pupil no longer knows which of the two ˙ mind or hand ˙ was responsible for the work but to get that far for the skill to become spiritual a concentration of all the physical and psychic forces is needed as in the art of archery˙ which as will be seen from the following examples cannot under any circumstances be dispensed with a painter seats himself before his pupils he examines his brush and slowly makes it ready for use carefully rubs ink straightens the long strip of paper that lies before him on the mat and finally after lapsing for a while into profound concentration in which he sits like one inviolable he produces with rapid absolutely sure strokes a picture which capable of no further correction and needing none serves the class as a model a flower master begins the lesson by cautiously untying the bast which holds together the flowers and sprays of blossom and laying it to one side carefully rolled up then he inspects the sprays one by one picks out the best after repeated examination cautiously bends them into the form which exactly corresponds with the role they are to play and finally places them together in an exquisite vase the completed picture looks just as if the master had guessed what nature had glimpsed in dark dreams in both these cases ˙ and i must confine myself to them ˙ the masters behave as if they were alone they hardly condescend to give their pupils a glance still less a word they carry out the preliminary movements musingly and composedly they efface themselves in the process of shaping and creating and to both the pupils and themselves it seems like a self − contained event from the first opening manoeuvres to the completed work and indeed the whole thing has such expressive power that it affects the beholder like a picture but why doesn’t the teacher allow these preliminaries unavoidable though they are to be done by an experienced pupil does it lend wings to his visionary and plastic powers if he rubs the ink himself if he unties the bast so elaborately instead of cutting it and carelessly throwing it away and what impels him to repeat this process at every single lesson and with the same remorseless insistence to make his pupils copy it without the least alteration he sticks to this traditional custom because he knows from experience that the preparations for working put him simultaneously in the right frame of mind for creating the meditative repose in which he performs them gives him that vital loosening and equability of all his powers that collectedness and presence of mind without which no right work can be done sunk without purpose in what he is doing he is brought face to face with that moment when the work hovering before him in ideal lines realizes itself as if of its own accord as with the steps and postures in archery so here in modified form other preparations have the same meaning and only where this does not apply as for instance with religious dancers and actors are the self−recollection and self−immersion practised before they appear on the stage as in the case of archery there can be no question but that these arts are ceremonies more clearly than the teacher could express it in words they tell the pupil that the right frame of mind for the artist is only reached when the preparing and the creating the technical and the artistic the material and the spiritual the project and the object flow together without a break and here he finds a new theme for emulation he is now required to exercise perfect control over the various ways of concentration and self−effacement imitation no longer applied to objective contents which anybody can copy with a little good will becomes looser nimbler more spiritual the pupil sees himself on the brink of new possibilities but discovers at the same time that their realization does not depend in the slightest degree on his good will assuming that his talent can survive the increasing strain there is one scarcely avoidable danger that lies ahead of the pupil on his road to mastery not the danger of wasting himself in idle self−gratification ˙ for the east has no aptitude for this cult of the ego˙but rather the danger of getting stuck in his achievement which is confirmed by his success and magnified by his renown in other words of behaving as if the artistic existence were a form of life that bore witness to its own validity the teacher foresees this danger carefully and with the adroitness of a psychopomp he seeks to head the pupil off in time and to detach him from himself this he does by pointing out casually and as though it were scarcely worth a mention in view of all that the pupil has already learned that all right doing is accomplished only in a state of true selflessness in which the doer cannot be present any longer as himself only the spirit is present a kind of awareness which shows no trace of ego− hood and for that reason ranges without limit through all the distances and depths with eyes that hear and with ears that see  thus the teacher lets his pupil voyage onward through himself but the pupil with growing receptiveness lets the teacher bring to view some thing of which he has often heard but whose reality is only now beginning to become tangible on the basis of his own experiences it is immaterial what name the teacher gives it whether indeed he names it at all the pupil understands him even when he keeps silent the important thing is that an inward movement is thereby initiated the teacher pursues it and without influencing its course with further instructions which would merely disturb it helps the pupil in the most secret and intimate way he knows by direct transference of the spirit as it is called in buddhist circles  just as one uses a burning candle to light others with so the teacher transfers the spirit of the right art from heart to heart that it may be illumined if such should be granted to the pupil he remembers that more important than all outward works however attractive is the inward work which he has to accomplish if he is to fulfil his vocation as an artist the inward work however consists in his turning the man he is and the self he feels himself and perpetually finds himself to be into the raw material of a training and shaping whose end is mastery in it the artist and the human being meet in something higher for mastery proves its validity as a form of life only when it dwells in the boundless truth and sustained by it becomes the art of the origin the master no longer seeks but finds as an artist he is the hieratic man as a man the artist into whose heart in all his doing and not−doing working and waiting being and not−being the buddha gazes the man the art the work ˙ it is all one the art of the inner work which unlike the outer does not forsake the artist which he does not  do and can only be springs from depths of which the day knows nothing steep is the way to mastery often nothing keeps the pupil on the move but his faith in his teacher whose mastery is now beginning to dawn on him he is a living example of the inner work and he convinces by his mere presence how far the pupil will go is not the concern of the teacher and master hardly has he shown him the right way when he must let him go on alone there is only one thing more he can do to help him endure his loneliness he turns him away from himself from the master by exhorting him to go further than he himself has done and to climb on the shoulders of his teacher  wherever his way may take him the pupil though he may lose sight of his teacher can never forget him with a gratitude as great as the uncritical veneration of the beginner as strong as the saving faith of the artist he now takes his master’s place ready for any sacrifice countless examples down to the recent past testify that this gratitude far exceeds the measure of what is customary among mankind vii day by day i found myself slipping more easily into the ceremony which sets forth the great doctrine of archery carrying it out effortlessly or to be more precise feeling myself being carried through it as in a dream thus far the master’s predictions were confirmed yet i could not prevent my concentration from flagging at the very moment when the shot ought to come waiting at the point of highest tension not only became so tiring that the tension relaxed but so agonizing that i was constantly wrenched out of my self−immersion and had to direct my attention to discharging the shot  stop thinking about the shot the master called out  that way it is bound to fail  i can’t help it i answered the tension gets too painful  you only feel it because you haven’t really let go of yourself it is all so simple you can learn from an ordinary bamboo leaf what ought to happen it bends lower and lower under the weight of snow suddenly the snow slips to the ground without the leaf having stirred stay like that at the point of highest tension until the shot falls from you so indeed it is when the tension is fulfilled the shot must fall it must fall from the archer like snow from a bamboo leaf before he even thinks it  in spite of everything i could do or did not do i was unable to wait until the shot fell as before i had no alternative but to loose it on purpose and this obstinate failure depressed me all the more since i had already passed my third year of instruction i will not deny that i spent many gloomy hours wondering whether i could justify this waste of time which seemed to bear no conceivable relationship to anything i had learned and experienced so far the sarcastic remark of a countryman of mine that there were important pickings to be made in japan besides this beggarly art came back to me and though i had dismissed it at the time his query as to what i intended to do with my art if ever i learned it no longer seemed to me so entirely absurd the master must have felt what was going on in my mind he had so mr komachiya told me later tried to work through a japanese introduction to philosophy in order to find out how he could help me from a side i already knew but in the end he had laid the book down with a cross face remarking that he could now understand that a person who interested himself in such things would naturally find the art of archery uncommonly difficult to learn we spent our summer holidays by the sea in the solitude of a quiet dreamy landscape distinguished for its delicate beauty we had taken our bows with us as the most important part of our equipment day out and day in i concentrated on loosing the shot this had become an idee fixe which caused me to forget more and more the master’s warning that we should not practise anything except self−detaching immersion turning all the possibilities over in my mind i came to the conclusion that the fault could not lie where the master suspected it in lack of purposelessness and egolessness but in the fact that the fingers of the right hand gripped the thumb too tight the longer i had to wait for the shot the more convulsively i pressed them together without thinking it was at this point i told myself that i must set to work and ere long i had found a simple and obvious solution to this problem if after drawing the bow i cautiously eased the pressure of the fingers on the thumb the moment came when the thumb no longer held fast was torn out of position as if spontaneously in this way a lightning loose could be made and the shot would obviously fall like snow from a bamboo leaf this discovery recommended itself to me not least on account of its beguiling affinity with the technique of rifle−shooting there the index finger is slowly crooked until an ever diminishing pressure overcomes the last resistance i was able to convince myself very quickly that i must be on the right track almost every shot went off smoothly and unexpectedly to my way of thinking naturally i did not overlook the reverse side of this triumph the precision work of the right hand demanded my full attention but i comforted myself with the hope that this technical solution would gradually become so habitual that it would require no further notice from me and that the day would come when thanks to it i should be in a position to loose the shot self− obliviously and unconsciously at the moment of highest tension and that in this case the technical ability would spiritualize itself waxing more and more confident in this conviction i silenced the protest that rose up in me ignored the contrary counsels from my wife and went away with the satisfying feeling of having taken a decisive step forward the very first shot i let off after the recommencement of the lessons was to my mind a brilliant success the loose was smooth unexpected the master looked at me for a while and then said hesitantly like one who can scarcely believe his eyes  once again please my second shot seemed to me even better than the first the master stepped up to me without a word took the bow from my hand and sat down on a cushion his back towards me i knew what that meant and withdrew the next day mr komachiya informed me that the master declined to instruct me any further because i had tried to cheat him horrified beyond measure by this interpretation of my behaviour i explained to mr komachiya why in order to avoid marking time forever i had hit upon this method of loosing the shot on his interceding for me the master was finally prepared to give in but made the continuation of the lessons conditional upon my express promise never to offend again against the spirit of the great doctrine  if profound shame had not cured me the master’s behaviour would certainly have done so he did not mention the incident by so much as a word but only said quite quietly  you see what comes of not being able to wait without purpose in the state of highest tension you cannot even learn to do this without continually asking yourself shall i be able to manage it wait patiently and see what comes˙and how it comes  i pointed out to the master that i was already in my fourth year and that my stay in japan was limited  the way to the goal is not to be measured of what importance are weeks months years  but what if i have to break off half way i asked  once you have grown truly egoless you can break off at any time keep on practising that  and so we began again from the very beginning as if everything i had learned hitherto had become useless but the waiting at the point of highest tension was no more successful than before as if itwere impossible for me to get out of the rut one day i asked the master how can the shot be loosed if  i do not do it  it shoots he replied  i have heard you say that several times before so let me put it another way how can i wait self− obliviously for the shot if  i am no longer there   it waits at the highest tension  and who or what is this it   once you have understood that you will have no further need of me and if i tried to give you a clue at the cost of your own experience i should be the worst of teachers and should deserve to be sacked so let’s stop talking about it and go on practising  weeks went by without my advancing a step at the same time i discovered that this did not disturb me in the least had i grown tired of the whole business whether i learned the art or not whether i experienced what the master meant by it or not whether i found the way to zen or not ˙ all this suddenly seemed to have become so remote so indifferent that it no longer troubled me several times i made up my mind to confide in the master but when i stood before him i lost courage i was convinced that i should never hear anything but the monotonous answer don’t ask practise so i stopped asking and would have liked to stop practising too had not the master held me inexorably in his grip i lived from one day to the next did my professional work as best i might and in the end ceased to bemoan the fact that all my efforts of the last few years had become meaningless then one day after a shot the master made a deep bow and broke off the lesson just then ît ˜ shot he cried as i stared at him bewildered and when i at last understood what he meant i couldn’t suppress a sudden whoop of delight  what i have said the master told me severely was not praise only a statement that ought not to touch you nor was my bow meant for you for you are entirely innocent of this shot you remained this time absolutely self−oblivious and without purpose in the highest tension so that the shot fell from you like a ripe fruit now go on practising as if nothing had happened only after a considerable time did more right shots occasionally come off which the master signalled by a deep bow how it happened that they loosed themselves without my doing anything how it came about that my tightly closed right hand suddenly flew back wide open i could not explain then and i cannot explain to−day the fact remains that it did happen and that alone is important but at least i got to the point of being able to distinguish on my own the right shots from the failures the qualitative difference is so great that it cannot be overlooked once it has been experienced outwardly for the observer the right shot is distinguished by the cushioning of the right hand as it is jerked back so that no tremor runs through the body again after wrong shots the pent−up breath is expelled explosively and the next breath cannot be drawn quickly enough after right shots the breath glides effortlessly to its end whereupon air is unhurriedly breathed in again the heart continues to beat evenly and quietly and with concentration undisturbed one can go straight on to the next shot but inwardly for the archer himself right shots have the effect of making him feel that the day has just begun he feels in the mood for all right doing and what is perhaps even more important for all right not − doing delectable indeed is this state but he who has it said the master with a subtle smile would do well to have it as though he did not have it only unbroken equanimity can accept it in such a way that it is not afraid to come back viii  well at least we’ve got over the worst i said to the master when he announced one day that we were going on to some new exercises he who has a hundred miles to walk should reckon ninety as half the journey he replied quoting the proverb  our new exercise is shooting at a target  what had served ’til now as a target and arrow− catcher was a roll of straw on a wooden stand which one faced at a distance of two arrows laid end to end the target on the other hand set up at a distance of about sixty feet stands on a high and broadly based bank of sand which is piled up against three walls and like the hall in which the archer stands is covered by a beautifully curved tile roof the two halls are connected by high wooden partitions which shut off from the outside the space where such strange things happen the master proceeded to give us a demonstration of target− shooting both arrows were embedded in the black of the target then he bade us perform the ceremony exactly as before and without letting ourselves be put off by the target wait at the highest tension until the shot fell the slender bamboo arrows flew off in the right direction but failed to hit even the sandbank still less the target and buried themselves in the ground just in front of it  your arrows do not carry observed the master because they do not reach far enough spiritually you must act as if the goal were infinitely far off for master archers it is a fact of common experience that a good archer can shoot further with a medium−strong bow than an unspiritual archer can with the strongest it does not depend on the bow but on the presence of mind on the vitality and awareness with which you shoot in order to unleash the full force of this spiritual awareness you must perform the ceremony differently rather as a good dancer dances if you do this your movements will spring from the centre from the seat of right breathing instead of reeling off the ceremony like something learned by heart it will then be as if you were creating it under the inspiration of the moment so that dance and dancer are one and the same by performing the ceremony like a religious dance your spiritual awareness will develop its full force  i do not know how far i succeeded in dancing the ceremony and thereby activating it from the centre i no longer shot too short but i still failed to hit the target this prompted me to ask the master why he had never yet explained to us how to take aim there must i supposed be a relation of sorts between the target and the tip of the arrow and hence an approved method of sighting which makes hitting possible  of course there is answered the master and you can easily find the required aim yourself but if you hit the target with nearly every shot you are nothing more than a trick archer who likes to show off for the professional who counts his hits the target is only a miserable piece of paper which he shoots to bits the great doctrine holds this to be sheer devilry it knows nothing of a target which is set up at a definite distance from the archer it only knows of the goal which cannot be aimed at technically and it names this goal if it names it at all the buddha  after these words which he spoke as though they were self− evident the master told us to watch his eyes closely as he shot as when performing the ceremony they were almost closed and we did not have the impression that he was sighting obediently we practised letting off our shots without taking aim at first i remained completely unmoved by where my arrows went even occasional hits did not excite me for i knew that so far as i was concerned they were only flukes but in the end this shooting into the blue was too much for me i fell back into the temptation to worry the master pretended not to notice my disquiet until one day i confessed to him that i was at the end of my tether  you worry yourself unnecessarily the master comforted me put the thought of hitting right out of your mind you can be a master even if every shot does not hit the hits on the target are only the outward proof and confirmation of your purposelessness at its highest of your egolessness your self−abandonment or whatever you like to call this state there are different grades of mastery and only when you have made the last grade will you be sure of not missing the goal  that is just what i cannot get into my head i answered  i think i understand what you mean by the real inner goal which ought to be hit but how it happens that the outer goal the disc of paper is hit without the archer’s taking aim and that the hits are only outward confirmations of inner events˙that correspondence is beyond me  you are under an illusion said the master after a while  if you imagine that even a rough understanding of these dark connections would help you these are processes which are beyond the reach of understanding do not forget that even in nature there are correspondences which cannot be understood and yet are so real that we have grown accustomed to them just as if they could not be any different i will give you an example which i have often puzzled over the spider dances her web without knowing that there are flies who will get caught in it the fly dancing nonchalantly on a sunbeam gets caught in the net without knowing what lies in store but through both of them ît ˜ dances and inside and outside are united in this dance so too the archer hits the target without having aimed˙more i cannot say  much as this comparison occupied my thoughts ˙ though i could not of course think it to a satisfactory conclusion˙ something in me refused to be mollified and would not let me go on practising unworried an objection which in the course of weeks had taken on more definite outline formulated itself in my mind i therefore asked is it not at least conceivable that after all your years of practice you involuntarily raise the bow and arrow with the certainty of a sleepwalker so that although you do not consciously take aim when drawing it you must hit the target˙simply cannot fail to hit it  the master long accustomed to my tiresome questions shook his head i do not deny he said after a short silence  that there may be something in what you say i do stand facing the goal in such a way that i am bound to see it even if i do not intentionally turn my gaze in that direction on the other hand i know that this seeing is not enough decides nothing explains nothing for i see the goal as though i did not see it  then you ought to be able to hit it blindfolded i jerked out the master turned on me a glance which made me fear that i had insulted him and then said  come to see me this evening  i seated myself opposite him on a cushion he handed me tea but did not speak a word so we sat for a long while there was no sound but the singing of the kettle on the hot coals at last the master rose and made me a sign to follow him the practice hall was brightly lit the master told me to put a taper long and thin as a knitting needle in the sand in front of the target but not to switch on the light in the target sand it was so dark that i could not even see its outlines and if the tiny flame of the taper had not been there i might perhaps have guessed the position of the target though i could not have made it out with any precision the master danced the ceremony his first arrow shot out of dazzling brightness into deep night i knew from the sound that it had hit the target the second arrow was a hit too when i switched on the light in the target−stand i discovered to my amazement that the first arrow was lodged full in the middle of the black while the second arrow had splintered the butt of the first and ploughed through the shaft before embedding itself beside it i did not dare to pull the arrows out separately but carried them back together with the target the master surveyed them critically the first shot he then said  was no great feat you will think because after all these years i am so familiar with my target−stand that i must know even in pitch darkness where the target is that may be and i won’t try to pretend otherwise but the second arrow which hit the first˙ what do you make of that i at any rate know that it is not î ˜ who must be given credit for this shot ît˜ shot and ît˜ made the hit let us bow to the goal as before the buddha  the master had evidently hit me too with both arrows as though transformed overnight i no longer succumbed to the temptation of worrying about my arrows and what happened to them the master strengthened me in this attitude still further by never looking at the target but simply keeping his eye on the archer as though that gave him the most suitable indication of how the shot had fallen out on being questioned he freely admitted that this was so and i was able to prove for myself again and again that his sureness of judgment in this matter was no whit inferior to the sureness of his arrows thus through deepest concentration he transferred the spirit of his art to his pupils and i am not afraid to confirm from my own experience which i doubted long enough that the talk of immediate communication is not just a figure of speech but a tangible reality there was another form of help which the master communicated to us at that time and which he likewise spoke of as immediate transference of the spirit if i had been continually shooting badly the master gave a few shots with my bow the improvement was startling it was as if the bow let itself be drawn differently more willingly more understandingly this did not happen only with me even his oldest and most experienced pupils men from all walks of life took this as an established fact and were astonished that i should ask questions like one who wished to make quite sure similarly no master of swordsmanship can be moved from his conviction that each of the swords fashioned with so much hard work and infinite care takes on the spirit of the swordsmith who therefore sets about his work in ritual costume their experiences are far too striking and they themselves far too skilled for them not to perceive how a sword reacts in their hands one day the master cried out the moment my shot was loosed it is there bow down to the goal later when i glanced towards the target˙ unfortunately i couldn’t help myself˙i saw that the arrow had only grazed the edge  that was a right shot said the master decisively and so it must begin but enough for to−day otherwise you will take special pains with the next shot and spoil the good beginning  occasionally several of these right shots came off in close succession and hit the target besides of course the many more that failed but if ever the least flicker of satisfaction showed in my face the master turned on me with unwonted fierceness  what are you thinking of he would cry you know already that you should not grieve over bad shots learn now not to rejoice over the good ones you must free yourself from the buffetings of pleasure and pain and learn to rise above them in easy equanimity to rejoice as though not you but another had shot well this too you must practise unceasingly˙you cannot conceive how important it is  during these weeks and months i passed through the hardest schooling of my life and though the discipline was not always easy for me to accept i gradually came to see how much i was indebted to it it destroyed the last traces of any preoccupation with myself and the fluctuations of my mood do you now understand the master asked me one day after a particularly good shot what i mean by it shoots it hits   i’m afraid i don’t understand anything any more at all  i answered even the simplest things have got in a muddle is it î ˜ who draws the bow or is it the bow that draws me into the state of highest tension do î ˜ hit the goal or does the goal hit me is ît ˜ spiritual when seen by the eyes of the body and corporeal when seen by the eyes of the spirit ˙ or both or neither bow arrow goal and and ego all melt into one another so that i can no longer separate them and even the need to separate has gone for as soon as i take the bow and shoot everything becomes so clear and straightforward and so ridiculously simple    now at last the master broke in  the bowstring has cut right through you  ix more than five years went by and then the master proposed that we pass a test it is not just a question of demonstrating your skill he explained an even higher value is set on the spiritual deportment of the archer down to his minutest gesture i expect you above all not to let yourself be confused by the presence of spectators but to go through the ceremony quite unperturbed as though we were by ourselves  nor during the weeks that followed did we work with the test in mind not a word was said about it and often the lesson was broken off after a few shots instead we were given the task of performing the ceremony at home executing its steps and postures with particular regard to right breathing and deep concentration we practised in the manner prescribed and discovered that hardly had we accustomed ourselves to dancing the ceremony without bow and arrow when we began to feel uncommonly concentrated after the first steps this feeling increased the more care we took to facilitate the process of concentration by relaxing our bodies and when at lesson time we again practised with bow and arrow these home exercises proved so fruitful that we were able to slip effortlessly into the state of presence of mind we felt so secure in ourselves that we looked forward to the day of the test and the presence of spectators with equanimity we passed the test so successfully that the master had no need to crave indulgence of the spectators with an embarrassed smile and were awarded diplomas on the spot each inscribed with the degree of mastery in which we stood the master brought the proceedings to an end by giving two masterly shots in robes of surpassing magnificence a few days later my wife in an open contest was awarded the master title in the art of flower arrangement from then on the lessons assumed a new face contenting himself with a few practice shots the master went on to expound the great doctrine in relation to the art of archery and to adapt it to the stage we had reached although he dealt in mysterious images and dark comparisons the meagrest hints were sufficient for us to understand what it was about he dwelt longest on the artless art which must be the goal of archery if it is to reach perfection he who can shoot with the horn of the hare and the hair of the tortoise and can hit the centre without bow horn and arrow hair he alone is master in the highest sense of the word˙master of the artless art indeed he is the artless art itself and thus master and no−master in one at this point archery considered as the unmoved movement the undanced dance passes over into zen  when i asked the master how we could get on without him on our return to europe he said  your question is already answered by the fact that i made you take a test you have now reached a stage where teacher and pupil are no longer two persons but one you can separate from me any time you wish even if broad seas lie between us i shall always be with you when you practise what you have learned i need not ask you to keep up your regular practising not to discontinue it on any pretext whatsoever and to let no day go by without your performing the ceremony even without bow and arrow or at least without having breathed properly i need not ask you because i know that you can never give up this spiritual archery do not ever write to me about it but send me photographs from time to time so that i can see how you draw the bow then i shall know everything i need to know  i must only warn you of one thing you have become a different person in the course of these years for this is what the art of archery means a profound and far−reaching contest of the archer with himself perhaps you have hardly noticed it yet but you will feel it very strongly when you meet your friends and acquaintances again in your own country things will no longer harmonize as before you will see with other eyes and measure with other measures it has happened to me too and it happens to all who are touched by the spirit of this art  in farewell and yet not in farewell the master handed me his best bow when you shoot with this bow you will feel the spirit of the master near you give it not into the hands of the curious and when you have passed beyond it do not lay it up in remembrance destroy it so that nothing remains but a heap of ashes  x after all this i fear the suspicion will have grown up in the minds of many readers that since archery is no longer of any importance in man−to−man contests it has survived merely as a highly sophisticated form of spirituality and has thus become sublimated in a not very healthy way and i can hardly blame them for thinking so it must therefore be emphasized once again that the japanese arts including the art of archery have not come under the influence of zen only in recent times but have been under its influence for centuries indeed a master archer of those far off days if put to the test would not have been able to make any statements about the nature of his art radically different from those made by a master to−day for whom the great doctrine  is a living reality throughout the centuries the spirit of this art has remained the same˙as little alterable as zen itself in order to dispel any lingering doubts˙which as i know from my own experience are understandable enough˙i propose for the sake of comparison to cast a glance at another of these arts whose martial significance even under present conditions cannot be denied the art of swordsmanship i make this attempt not only because master awa was a fine  spiritual swordsman as well and occasionally pointed out to me the striking resemblance between the experiences of master archers and master swordsmen but even more because there exists a literary document of the highest importance dating from feudal times when chivalry was in full flower and master swordsmen had to demonstrate their prowess in the most irrevocable way at the risk of their lives this is a treatise by the great zen master takuan entitled `the unmoved understanding where the connection of zen with the art of swordsmanship and with the practice of the sword contest is dealt with at considerable length i do not know whether it is the only document to expound the great doctrine of swordsmanship in such detail and with so much originality still less do i know whether there are similar testimonies with regard to the art of archery however that may be it is a great stroke of luck that takuan’s report has been preserved and a great service on d t suzuki’s part to have translated this letter to a famous swordmaster more or less unabridged and thus made it available to a wide circle of readers arranging and summarizing the material in my own way i shall try to explain as clearly and succinctly as possible what one understood by swordsmanship in the past and what in the unanimous opinion of the great masters one has to understand by it today  suzuki daisetz teitaro zen buddhism and its influence on japanese culture kyoto the eastern buddhist society 1938 xi among swordmasters on the basis of their own and their pupils’ experience it is taken as proved that the beginner however strong and pugnacious he is and however courageous and fearless he may be at the outset loses not only his lack of self−consciousness but his self−confidence as soon as he starts taking lessons he gets to know all the technical possibilities by which his life may be endangered in combat and although he soon becomes capable of straining his attention to the utmost of keeping a sharp watch on his opponent of parrying his thrusts correctly and making effective lunges he is really worse off than before when half in jest and half in earnest he struck about him at random under the inspiration of the moment and as the joy of battle suggested he is now forced to admit that he is at the mercy of everyone who is stronger more nimble and more practised than he he sees no other way open to him except ceaseless practise and his instructor too has no other advice to give him for the present so the beginner stakes everything on surpassing the others and even himself he acquires a brilliant technique which gives him back some of his lost self−confidence and thinks he is drawing nearer and nearer to the desired goal the instructor however thinks differently˙ and rightly so avers takuan since all the skill of the beginner only leads to his heart being snatched away by the sword  yet the initial instruction cannot be imparted in any other way it is thoroughly suited to the beginner all the same it does not lead to the goal as the instructor knows only too well that the pupil does not become a swordmaster despite his zeal and even despite his inborn skill is understandable enough but why is it that he who has long since learned not to let himself be swept away by the heat of battle but to keep a cool head to conserve his strength and who now feels inured to long−drawn combats and can hardly find an opponent to match him in all his circle˙why is it that judged by the highest standards he fails at the last moment and makes no headway the reason according to takuan is that the pupil cannot stop watching his opponent and his swordplay that he is always thinking how he can best come at him waiting for the moment when he is off his guard in short he relies all the time on his art and knowledge by so doing takuan says he loses his  presence of heart the decisive thrust always comes too late and he is unable to turn his opponent’s sword against him  the more he tries to make the brilliance of his swordplay dependent on his own reflection on the conscious utilization of his skill on his fighting experience and tactics the more he inhibits the free working of the heart what is to be done how does skill become spiritual and how does sovereign control of technique turn into master swordplay only so we are informed by the pupil becoming purposeless and egoless he must be taught to be detached not only from his opponent but from himself he must pass through the stage he is still at and leave it behind him for good even at the risk of irretrievable failure does not this sound as nonsensical as the demand that the archer should hit without taking aim that he should completely lose sight of the goal and his intention to hit it it is worth remembering however that the master swordsmanship whose essence takuan describes has vindicated itself in a thousand contests the instructor’s business is not to show the way itself but to enable the pupil to get the feel of this way to the goal by adapting it to his individual peculiarities he will therefore begin by training him to avoid thrusts instinctively even when they take him completely by surprise d t suzuki describes in a delicious anecdote the exceedingly original method employed by one instructor to submit himself to this far from easy task  the japanese fencing master sometimes uses the zen method of training once when a disciple came to a master to be disciplined in the art of fencing the master who was in retirement in his mountain hut agreed to undertake the task the pupil was made to help him gather wood for kindling draw water from the nearby spring split wood make the fire cook rice sweep the rooms and the garden and generally look after his household affairs there was no regular or technical teaching in the art after some time the young man became dissatisfied for he had not come to work as a servant to the old gentleman but to learn the art of swordsmanship so one day he approached the master and asked him to teach him the master agreed the result was that the young man could not do any piece of work with any feeling of safety for when he began to cook rice early in the morning the master would appear and strike him from behind with a stick when he was in the midst of his sweeping he would be feeling the same blow from somewhere from an unknown direction he had no peace of mind he had to be always on the qui vive some years passed before he could successfully dodge the blow from whatever source it might come but the master was not quite satisfied with him yet one day the master was found cooking his own vegetables over an open fire the pupil took it into his head to avail himself of this opportunity taking up his big stick he let it fall on the head of the master who was then stooping over the cooking pan to stir its contents but the pupil’s stick was caught by the master with the cover of the pan this opened the pupil’s mind to the secrets of the art which had hitherto been kept from him he then for the first time really appreciated the unparalleled kindness of the master  the pupil must develop a new sense or more accurately a new alertness of all his senses which will enable him to avoid dangerous thrusts as though he could feel them coming once he has mastered this art of evasion he no longer needs to watch with undivided attention the movements of his opponent or even of several opponents at once rather he sees and feels what is going to happen and at that same moment he has already avoided its effect without there being a hair’s breadth  between perceiving and avoiding this then is what counts a lightning reaction which has no further need of conscious observation in this respect at least the pupil makes himself independent of all conscious purpose and that is a great gain  suzuki daisetz teitaro zen buddhism and its influence on japanese culture pp 7 8 what is very much more difficult and of truly decisive importance is the task of stopping the pupil from thinking and spying out how he can best come at his opponent actually he should clear his mind of the thought that he has to do with an opponent at all and that it is a matter of life and death to begin with the pupil understands these instructions˙and he can hardly do otherwise˙as meaning that it is sufficient for him to refrain from observing and thinking about the behaviour of his opponent he takes this non−observation very seriously and controls himself at every step but he fails to notice that by concentrating his attention on himself he inevitably sees himself as the combatant who has at all costs to avoid watching his opponent do what he may he still has him secretly in mind only in appearance has he detached himself from him and the more he endeavours to forget him the more tightly he binds himself to him it takes a good deal of very subtle psychological guidance to convince the pupil that fundamentally he has gained nothing by this shift of attention he must learn to disregard himself as resolutely as he disregards his opponent and to become in a radical sense self−regardless purposeless much patience much heart−breaking practice is needed just as in archery but once this practice has led to the goal the last trace of self−regard vanishes in sheer purposelessness this state of purposeless detachment is followed automatically by a mode of behaviour which bears a surprising resemblance to the previous stage of instinctive evasion just as at that stage there was not a hair’s breadth between perceiving the intended thrust and evading it so now there is no time lag between evasion and action at the moment of evasion the combatant reaches back to strike and in a flash the deadly stroke has fallen sure and irresistible it is as if the sword wielded itself and just as we say in archery that it takes aim and hits so here it takes the place of the ego availing itself of a facility and a dexterity which the ego only acquires by conscious effort and here too it is only a name for something which can neither be understood nor laid hold of and which only reveals itself to those who have experienced it perfection in the art of swordsmanship is reached according to takuan when the heart is troubled by no more thought of i and you of the opponent and his sword of one’s own sword and how to wield it˙no more thought even of life and death all is emptiness your own self the flashing sword and the arms that wield it even the thought of emptiness is no longer there from this absolute emptiness states takuan comes the most wondrous unfoldment of doing  what is true of archery and swordsmanship also applies to all the other arts thus mastery in ink painting is only attained when the hand exercising perfect control over technique executes what hovers before the mind’s eye at the same moment as the mind begins to form it without there being a hair’s breadth between painting then becomes spontaneous calligraphy here again the painter’s instructions might be spend ten years observing bamboos become a bamboo yourself then forget everything and ˙ paint the swordmaster is as unselfconscious as the beginner the nonchalance which he forfeited at the beginning of his instruction he wins back again at the end as an indestructible characteristic but unlike the beginner he holds himself in reserve is quiet and unassuming without the least desire to show off between the stages of apprenticeship and mastership there lie long and eventful years of un−tiring practice under the influence of zen his proficiency becomes spiritual and he himself grown ever freer through spiritual struggle is transformed the sword which has now become his soul no longer rests lightly in its scabbard he draws it only when unavoidable thus it may easily happen that he avoids combat with an unworthy opponent a cockscomb who brags about his muscles accepting the charge of cowardice with smiling indifference though on the other hand out of esteem for an opponent he will insist on a combat which cannot bring anything but an honourable death to the latter these are the sentiments that govern the ethos of the samurai the incomparable path of chivalry known as bushido for higher than anything else higher than fame victory and even life stands the sword of truth which guides him and judges him like the beginner the swordmaster is fearless but unlike him he grows daily less and less accessible to fear years of unceasing meditation have taught him that life and death are at bottom the same and belong to the same stratum of fact he no longer knows what fear of life and terror of death are he lives ˙and this is thoroughly characteristic of zen˙happily enough in the world but ready at any time to quit it without being in the least disturbed by the thought of death it is not for nothing that the samurai have chosen for their truest symbol the fragile cherry blossom like a petal dropping in the morning sunlight and floating serenely to earth so must the fearless detach himself from life silent and inwardly unmoved to be free from the fear of death does not mean pretending to oneself in one’s good hours that one will not tremble in the face of death and that there is nothing to fear rather he who masters both life and death is free from fear of any kind to the extent that he is no longer capable of experiencing what fear feels like those who do not know the power of rigorous and protracted meditation cannot judge of the self−conquests it makes possible at any rate the perfected master betrays his fearlessness at every turn not in words but in his whole demeanour one has only to look at him to be profoundly affected by it unshakable fearlessness as such already amounts to mastery which in the nature of things is realized only by the few as proof of this i shall quote a passage from the hagakure which dates from about the middle of the seventeenth century  yagyu tagjima−no−kami was a great swordsman and teacher in the art to the shogun of the time tokugawa iyemitsu one of the personal guards of the shogun one day came to tajima−nokami wishing to be trained in fencing the master said âs i observe you seem to be a master of fencing yourself pray tell me to what school you belong before we enter into the relationship of teacher and pupil ˜ the guardsman said î am ashamed to confess that i have never learned the art˜ âre you trying to fool me i am teacher to the honourable shogun himself and i know my judging eye never fails˜ î am sorry to defy your honour but i really know nothing˜ this resolute denial on the part of the visitor made the swordsmaster think for a while and he finally said îf you say so it must be so but still i am sure you are a master of something though i do not know of what ˜ îf you insist i will tell you there is one thing of which i can say i am complete master when i was still a boy the thought came upon me that as a samurai i ought in no circumstances to be afraid of death and i have grappled with the problem of death now for some years and finally the problem of death ceased to worry me may this be at what you hint˜ exactly exclaimed tajima−no−kami that is what i mean i am glad that i made no mistake in my judgment for the ultimate secrets of swordsmanship also lie in being released from the thought of death i have trained ever so many hundreds of my pupils along this line but so far none of them really deserve the final certificate for swordsmanship you need no technical training you are already a master  since ancient times the practice hall where the swordsman’s art is learned has been called the place of enlightenment  every master who practises an art moulded by zen is like a flash of lightning from the cloud of all−encompassing truth this truth is present in the free movement of his spirit and he meets it again in it as his own original and nameless essence he meets this essence over and over again as his own being’s utmost possibilities so that the truth assumes for him˙ and for others through him˙a thousand shapes and forms in spite of the unexampled discipline to which he has patiently and humbly subjected himself he is still a long way from being so permeated and irradiated by zen that he is sustained by it in everything he does so that his life knows only good hours the supreme freedom has still not become a necessity for him  suzuki daisetz teitaro zen buddhism and its influence on japanese culture pp 46 47 if he is irresistibly driven towards this goal he must set out on his way again take the road to the artless art he must dare to leap into the origin so as to live by the truth and in the truth like one who has become one with it he must become a pupil again a beginner conquer the last and steepest stretch of the way undergo new transformations if he survives its perils then is his destiny fulfilled face to face he beholds the unbroken truth the truth beyond all truths the formless origin of origins the void which is the all is absorbed into it and from it emerges reborn  17  you’re a lucky girl today         the young nurse cleared my breakfast tray away and left me wrapped in my white blanket like a passenger taking the sea air on the deck of a ship         why am i lucky         well i’m not sure if you’re supposed to know yet but today you’re moving to belsize the nurse looked at me expectantly         belsize i said i can’t go there         why not         i’m not ready i’m not well enough         of course you’re well enough don’t worry they wouldn’t be moving you if you weren’t well enough         after the nurse left i tried to puzzle out this new move on doctor nolan’s part what was she trying to prove i hadn’t changed nothing had changed and belsize was the best house of all from belsize people went back to work and back to school and back to their homes         joan would be at belsize joan with her physics books and her golf clubs and her badminton rackets and her breathy voice joan marking the gulf between me and the nearly well ones ever since joan left caplan i’d followed her progress through the asylum grapevine         joan had walk privileges joan had shopping privileges joan had town privileges i gathered all my news of joan into a little bitter heap though i received it with surface gladness joan was the beaming double of my old best self specially designed to follow and torment me         perhaps joan would be gone when i got to belsize         at least at belsize i could forget about shock treatments at caplan a lot of the women had shock treatments i could tell which ones they were because they didn’t get their breakfast trays with the rest of us they had their shock treatments while we breakfasted in our rooms and then they came into the lounge quiet and extinguished led like children by the nurses and ate their breakfasts there         each morning when i heard the nurse knock with my tray an immense relief flooded through me because i knew r was out of danger for that day i didn’t see how doctor nolan could tell you went to sleep during a shock treatment if she’d never had a shock treatment herself how did she know the person didn’t just look as if he was asleep while all the time inside he was feeling the blue volts and the noise  piano music sounded from the end of the hall         at supper i sat quietly listening to the chatter of the belsize women they were all fashionably dressed and carefully made up and several of them were married some of them had been shopping downtown and others had been out visiting with friends and all during supper they kept tossing back and forth these private jokes         i’d call jack a woman named deedee said only i’m afraid he wouldn’t be home i know just where i could call him though and he’d be in all right         the short spry blonde woman at my table laughed i almost had doctor loring where i wanted him today she widened her starey blue eyes like a little doll i wouldn’t mind trading old percy in for a new model         at the opposite end of the room joan was wolfing her spam and broiled tomato with great appetite she seemed perfectly at home among these women and treated me coolly with a slight sneer like a dim and inferior acquaintance         i had gone to bed right after supper but then i heard the piano music and pictured joan and deedee and loubelle the blonde woman and the rest of them laughing and gossiping about me in the living room behind my back they would be saying how awful it was to have people like me in belsize and that i should be in wymark instead         i decided to put a lid on their nasty talk         draping my blanket loosely around my shoulders like a stole i wandered down the hall toward the light and the gay noise         for the rest of the evening i listened to deedee thump out some of her own songs on the grand piano while the other women sat round playing bridge and chatting just the way they would in a college dormitory only most of them were ten years over college age         one of them a great tall grayhaired woman with a booming bass voice named mrs savage had gone to vassar i could tell right away she was a society woman because she talked about nothing but debutantes it seemed she had two or three daughters and that year they were all going to be debutantes only she had loused up their debutante party by signing herself into the asylum         deedee had one song she called the milkman and everybody kept saying she ought to get it published it would be a hit first her hands would clop out a little melody on the keys like the hoofbeats of a slow pony and next another melody came in like the milkman whistling and then the two melodies went on together         that’s very nice i said in a conversational voice         joan was leaning on one corner of the piano and leafing through a new issue of some fashion magazine and deedee smiled up at her as if the two of them shared a secret         oh esther joan said then holding the magazine isn’t this you         deedee stopped playing let me see she took the magazine peered at the page joan pointed to and then glanced back at me         oh no deedee said surely not she looked at the magazine again then at me never         oh but it is esther isn’t it esther joan said chapter 8     through three terms as a une representative a subsequent two terms as une senator and now his appointment as secretary of defense bob pope had developed a reputation as being strong on defense and tough on the nidu pope wouldnt argue the first of these—it was a bedrock position that got him elected five times appointed once and earned him truly fantastic honoraria whenever he was between political gigs but the fact of the matter was he personally couldnt give a shit about the nidu one way or another as a people hed met more than his share of nidu in his time in washington of course and they were decent enough as intelligent nonhumans go they all had a pole up their reptilian ass about personal status but that just made them like everyone else in washington what he didnt like about them ironically was their status in the common confederation and by consequence the status of earth its colonies and humans in general as pope saw it the nidu for all their obsession about castes and status and class were bottom feeders in the grand cc food chain if the cc were the united nations the nidu would be burkina faso a tiny shitty little country on a chronically backwards continent with no hope of ever doing anything but pounding dirt the long merry day the problem was that the nidu were earths closest allies in the common confederation in politics as in high school who you are is to a large extent defined by who you sit with at lunch and there was no doubt about it the earth was sitting at the loser table it was not bob pope thought the true destiny of the earth in our universe to be counted among the diplomatic equivalent of the acneridden and the furtively masturbating a necessary step in escaping this fate was to turn nidu from a nominally friendly ally to a vaguely hostile one it wouldnt do to have the nidu as a fullfledged enemy of course despite popes opinion of the nidus station in galactic diplomacy nidu was still significantly more powerful than earth and her tiny colonies burkina faso or not she could still squash the earth like a bug but an edgy relationship made for better defense allocations better defense allocations made for better ships better soldiers and better weapons better weapons made for more diplomatic respect more diplomatic respect meant a chance to trade up on allies pope was aware there were other ways to get more diplomatic respect than bigger guns of course but while other diplomatic maneuvers sometimes worked and sometimes didnt ultimately a big damn gun always commanded respect it was a simple diplomatic equation and bob pope was not one for unnecessarily complicating things however if it was necessary to complicate things pope could live with that especially if in doing so he got close to his own goals but especially if he were complicating things for someone he didnt like like say that smug bastard jim heffer at the state department which is why after phipps had gotten him up to speed on the sheep issue pope made an executive decision we need to force states hand he said phipps raised an eyebrow why do we need to do that theyre already going to come up empty relations are already going to be damaged its not enough pope said they wont be damaged enough heffer can still convince the nidu they made the good faith effort we need to poke a stick through that wheel okay phipps said doubtfully he wasnt quite sure he followed the allusion what do you suggest the girl is going to be handled pope said right phipps said no more need be said on that issue from that point forward it was best that pope didnt know the specifics then we let the nidu know she exists pope said we cant do that phipps said we cant pope agreed but im sure that there are others who would be delighted to share the information phipps brightened i know just the man for the job chapter 15     in one of those coincidences that would be ridiculous if they werent entirely true creek and robins lifepod launched from the neverland at almost precisely the moment the time limit for the aufgetag clan to begin the coronation ceremony expired what followed next was a power grab so quick so balletic in its balance grace and speed that the medicis the borgias and all their equivalents across time and space had they the knowledge would have risen from their graves to provide its mastermind with a standing ovation at the time of the expiration plus some infinitesimal fraction of a second the nidu computer system deployed the instruction set enacted when no heir from the current clan on the throne ascends in time the power of supreme access previously locked in trust for the presumptive aufgetag heir was now dissolved and major functions of the nidu political administrations apportioned to the ministers and generals who made up the highest level of the nidu government from this second until a challenger successfully assumed the throne no single nidu was in charge of the entire government at time plus two minutes to use human time measurements ghadaufgetag supreme commander of nidu military and uncle to the previously presumptive but now merely potential heir to the throne hubuaufgetag found his head being yanked backward to expose his throat for the two minutes previous ghadaufgetag had sole administrative control of the nidu military without oversight from the nidu fehen—because there was none ghadaufgetag had not used those two minutes particularly well for their entire span he been squatting above a nidu toilet trough expelling the remains of the previous days lunch this left him particularly vulnerable to attack when his two bodyguards entered his lavatory and drew their knives—ceremonial knives ghadaufgetag had presented both a year previously as a token often nidu years roughly fifteen earth years of loyal and devoted service both bodyguards had been promised colonial regional governorships by narfwingetag both had decided that narfwingetags offer beat a nice knife one of those knives was stuck in ghadaufgetags throat a few seconds later the second cut him from waist to midchest ghadaufgetags bodyguards were brutally efficient in dispatching their master by tplus three minutes and thirty seconds all of ghadaufgetags brain activity had ceased triggering the implant he like all highlevel government officials carried in his body to transmit the fact of his death to the nidu computer network with the death of ghadaufgetag the administrative powers he controlled were instantaneously and automatically portioned off to his immediate subordinates the chiefs of staff of the respective arms of the nidu military—except for the control of nidus gzarclasss destroyers which ghadaufgetag and the previous fehen wejaufgetag believed was too important to be left to a mere chief of staff ghadaufgetag kept control of the glar destroyers himself and cut them out of the chain of command and so when he collapsed to the tiles of his lavatory bled out control of the glar destroyers devolved directly to their individual commanders six of whom narfwingetag had been able to buy at tplus five minutes—and in a truly remarkable bit of synchronization—both the the ludchogetag and the jubbgahgetag the two glar destroyers une defense had been tracking from the start emerged in earth space in an unauthorized and unscheduled appearance and immediately warmed up their weapons une defense commanders had been briefed on the possibility of the appearance of the two cruisers and the further possibility—probability—that they would not be stopping by for a friendly spot of tea what they were not told to expect was that the two ships would appear in earth space within thirty seconds of each other a bit of coordination that was an unheardof feat of planning and power distribution to nspace engines considering that the ships had come from entirely different limbs of known space and were known to have entered nspace at nearly exactly the same time the appearance of both simultaneously gave earth defense planners no time to counter bob pope was awakened from a dead sleep by his new temporary assistant thomas gervis he in turn woke up president webster webster held off attacking the destroyers partly to keep from losing une defense ships unnecessarily but also because until he heard otherwise nidu was still an ally the unbidden and unscheduled arrival of the destroyers was not enough to breach treaties if the une moved to attack it would be the aggressor and the breaker of treaties there was nothing to do but wait the commanders of the lud and the jubb were both bought off years before with their choice of planetary colony governorships the captain of the lud picked hynn one of the newer colonies rich in natural resources and anecdotally believed to be the home of some of the most attractive nidu females in the entire nation a perennially popular nidu folk tune that expressed a belief to that effect had a close cousin in earths equally perennially popular folk tune california girls the captain of the jubb had lost two dearly beloved siblings in the uprisings on chagfun he chose that colony to rule and was already constructing intricate revenge fantasies against its entire population narfwingetag had had no problem convincing ghadaufgetag and hubuaufgetag to dispatch the lud and the jubb to earth space the two had already been convinced by the apparent assassination of larswingetag that the earth government was acting against their and therefore nidus best interests and the further unfolding of events suggested it would have to be dealt with as soon as possible after the coronation ceremony what had been far more difficult had been to convince the two to do what was coming up next at tplus 12 minutes four glar destroyers with two future colonial governors one future supreme commander of nidu military and one future very very rich retired captain among them popped into existence over nidu itself joining the two glar destroyers already on station in nidu orbit all four arrived within 20 seconds of each other—a feat one order of magnitude more impressive than the synchronized arrival at earth—two each in positions flanking the two glar cruisers already in orbit this had been narfwingetags improvisational masterstroke and like many masterful improvisations it was based on years of backstory narfwingetag knew that two of the glar captains could not be purchased—they were nephews of ghadaufgetag and cousins of hubuaufgetag rather than buy them he bought those around them not to assassinate the cousins but to implicate them in a deep and subtle conspiracy against hubuaufgetag that would come to light at a time of narfwingetags choosing at the appropriate moment which eventually turned out to be just after the une began the search that would turn up robin baker a trusted and apparently unimpeachable third party—who in a refreshing change of pace for narfwingetag was not bought but blackmailed—would come forward and present evidence that the cousins meant to prevent the coronation and use their destroyers to force a coup this third party would then suggest recalling the four remaining glar cruisers as a preventative measure the third party chaaaufgetag brother of ghadaufgetag uncle to hubuaufgetag and father to the glar destroyer captains in question who really ought to have known that a fetish for xenosexuality—the desire to have sex with sentient races not your own—would one day catch up with him in a culture as casteridden and implicitly racist and xenophobic as the nidu no matter how shamed chaaaufgetag would be if his alienfucking ways were discovered there would be no way hed countenance the actual murder of his own children which is why narfwingetag never bothered to explain to him what would happen at tplus 15 minutes when the four destroyers opened fire on the destroyers captained by his sons the two destroyers were of course entirely unprepared for the attack—and yet survived the first barrage heavily damaged but largely intact a testament to their hamgp makers superior shipbuilding skills but even advanced hamgp craftsmanship couldnt survive the impact of a nidu planet cracker bomb one of which hit each of the stricken destroyers as the sole weapons in a second wave of attack the destroyers each disintegrated in the wake of a shaped blast designed to rip into the skin of a living world leaving nothing but metallic vapor and a pair of explosive jets expanding conically away from the planet of nidu it would have killed chaaaufgetag to know he had been used to condemn his sons to death so it was just as well that at tplus six minutes chaaaufgetags trusted personal servant of nearly two decades stuck a largegauge shotgun into chaaaufgetags exceptionally surprised face and calmly pulled the trigger this was another instance where narfwingetag didnt have to make a payout or promise the personal servant a nidu of extreme conservative personal inclinations saw it as an opportunity to express his opinion about chaaaufgetags need to stick his penile array into places people and species it ought not have been having expressed the opinion the personal servant then turned the shotgun on himself his personal inclinations being conservative as they were it was the only option that would suffice for a disloyal servant at tplus 20 minutes hubuaufgetag received a recorded message from narfwingetag briefly outlining the events of the last several minutes and informing the former future leader of the nidu that he already had robin baker or would have soon and when he arrived at nidu with her in two days time it would be narfwingetag not hubuaufgetag who would use her to ascend the throne of nidu and if hubuaufgetag didnt like it he was free to eat a planet cracker bomb from one of the four glar cruisers that floated above nidu all of which—as well as the two orbiting earth—were under narfwingetags control in another one of those coincidences at the very moment narfwingetags message to hubuaufgetag stopped playing leaving hubuaufgetag to fathom how this all could have happened the lifepod carrying creek and robin baker scraped across the surface of chagfun grinding to a stop less than a kilometer from the communication outpost on the pajmhi plain and so it was that in 20 minutes narfwingetag found himself in effective control of two entire planets it was almost certainly the fastest double coup in the history of the common confederation—which even in an obscure historical category such as double coup was an impressive feat all that was left now was to make it official all that was left was to get robin baker and take her to nidu    robin baker looked at around at the hard black rocky expanse she and creek stood on so this is where you fought she said this is it creek said he winced as he pulled another small fragment of his communicator from his leg then swabbed the wound with the disinfectant from the pods first aid kit which had been placed along with a small store of water and emergency rations in a small sealed compartment under the pod floor it didnt look like this though robin said creek looked around no he said it used to be a lot nicer well as much as any battleground can be nice when i was here i wasnt getting a lot of time to sightsee i guess not robin said ill tell you though creek said as he wrapped gauze around his leg one time in the two days i was here everything just stopped—rifles stopped firing people stopped moving and everything just became quiet and it was like everyone had just stopped to take a breath or something and for that moment you could look around and see what a beautiful place the plain was when it wasnt filled with people killing and dying and i wished i had been able to see the place when it was at peace its at peace now robin said if you want to call being buried under a lava flow at peace creek said he stood up and walked on his leg how does that feel robin asked like there are a couple of pieces still in there creek said ouch robin said better plastic fragments in my leg than a bullet creek said theyll eventually work themselves out anyway now that my communicator is shot—literally—were going to have to make the hike to that communications center leff was talking about robin pointed to a tall communications array roughly a kilometer away im guessing that would be it she said im guessing youd be right creek said ready for a walk i like how you ask me these things as if youre giving me the option robin said youve been doing this all the time since weve met i just want you to know that it doesnt really make me feel like i have a choice in the matter creek smiled i dont want to come across as pushy he said its a little late for that robin said come on im sure this place used to be a very nice place to visit but right now all i want to do is get off this rock and on that nice big navy boat up there she set off in the direction of the communications array creek collected up the nidu rifle placed the finger in his pocket grabbed a water canister and followed after robin the communications array terminated in a small control room located in a natural if irregular amphitheater created by the lava flow this was where the memorial ceremony was scheduled to take place like every portion of the former plain the amphitheater was bleak black rock with no sign of animal life or vegetation it was as if life insulted by the planet cracker and resulting lava flow had rejected the plain of pajmhi from that point forward creek didnt blame it for the decision harry robin said and pointed to something on the side of the control room creek looked at what seemed like a heap of trash for a minute until it resolved itself into a dead nidu probably the communications engineer who had come to the site to prepare for the neverland passenger arrival creek turned back to robin head back to the pod he said wait there until i come to get you harry— robin said looking past his shoulder creek swung around and saw something the size of a grizzly stalking toward him it had come through the door of the communication center creek raised up his nidu rifle sighted in and fired at the thing and forgot the nidu finger was still in his pants pocket oh shit creek said and wheeled backward the creature grabbed him cocked back its massive arm and slugged him dead in the temple creek could hear robin scream for the briefest fraction of a second before the lights went out completely    creek felt water splashing on his face and into his nostrils he coughed himself back into consciousness and propped himself up from the floor he was lying upon hello creek a mans voice said to him nice nap creek looked up and saw rod acuna over him leaning against the counter of the broadcast terminal inside the communications control center acuna held a gun casually but firmly in his hand it was pointed at creek behind and to the side of acuna creek saw robin securely held by what creek now recognized as a nagch hello acuna creek said of all the people i was expecting to see you were not one of them you know who i am acuna said well isnt that cozy im glad i could surprise you surprises are fun and you know i think you should take my presence here as a compliment really creek said how so it shows my faith in you creek acuna said after i got that picture of you in my regimental newsletter and passed it along everyone else was so sure that they would just pluck you and little bo peep here off that cruise liner but i knew better i knew youd get away from them and you know why dont you because i got away from you creek said check out the brain on you acuna said exactly right you got away from me so i asked myself if i were harry creek and i was going to keep from getting captured on a cruise liner in space where would i go and here we are i had to just about shoot someone to make them give me a ride down here but now i think theyll be glad i made the effort you came with the nidu creek said i did acuna said and im going to leave with them and so is takk here—he gestured with his nongunholding hand to the nagch—and so is your girlfriend you on the other hand will be staying no room on the shuttle for me creek said theres room acuna said youre not going to go because you and i are going to settle up now you broke my arm and my nose in our last encounter if youll recall it cost someone a lot of money for my quickheal session sorry about that creek said think nothing of it acuna said and shot creek in the left arm midway between the wrist and elbow shattering his radius and ulna creek collapsed on the ground writhing in pain smearing blood on the concrete floor robin screamed again and started begging for someone to help them acuna watched creek twist for a while and then got up from the counter and walked over to him that takes care of the arm acuna said and kicked creek square in the face causing a burst of blood to fountain out his nose and that should square us for the broken nose he stepped away and raised his gun and this is the interest on both goodbye creek    takk was only mildly interested in the interaction between acuna and creek what he was more interested in—indeed what he was almost entirely consumed with—was robin acuna had retrieved robin while takk had carried creek into the comm center once inside however they swapped try not to lose her acuna had said shoving the girl at takk who looked up at him with terrified eyes takk gently put his huge paw on her shoulder dont worry takk said im not going to hurt you you just clubbed my friend into a coma robin said pardon me if i dont relax there it was just like it was prophesied by dwellin the lamb will come to the house of strangers with a journey of many miles behind it it will be made welcome by those who dwell within but will be yet full of fears takk had been reading the prophecies pretty much nonstop since archie mcclellan had handed them over prior to ingestion if d be fair to say that hed memorized most of them at this point nagch had excellent memories for the written word they had fascinated takk he was not by inclination one easily swayed by mysticism preferring instead the sense of order and comforting ritual religion could provide after reading the preface to the prophecies he would have considered himself more of an ironist than an empathist if he were a member of the church yet there was something compelling about the idea that these prophecies not only might come true but were thought to come true through the conscious decision of the church members to make them so it was an interesting juxtaposition between fate and free will that allowed for both to exist—nay required them to go handinhand skipping merrily through the field  takk recognized of course that the prophecy he was thinking of was not an exact fit the communications hut could be considered a house only in the broadest and most liberal sense of the term the one that granted that any structure could theoretically be a home to someone and yet other elements fit very well had not the lamb traveled many miles indeed—lightyears in fact a distance that made mockery of the term mile did takk not just tell her not to worry and did so unprompted by prophecy—he only consciously thought of the prophecy afterward and was she not and reasonably so takk thought full of fears takk racked his brain for other prophecies that matched the situation but came up empty there was nothing in the prophecies that said anything about someone like acuna antagonizing someone like this creek fellow this didnt entirely surprise takk either theres not a prophecy for everything in the universe even if one is willing to deconstruct the writing down to its most general and symbolic level dwellin was understandably focused on the issues surrounding the evolved lamb and its trials hed naturally skip parts here and there from what takk understood of the background of the prophecies and dwellin by the end he was wellnigh incoherent off of alcohol and cheap overthecounter pharmaceuticals it would have been difficult for him to develop and sustain more than one prophetic narrative acuna shot creek in the arm creek who been propping himself up with the arm fell back to the floor bleeding and moaning robin screamed oh god oh god she said oh god harry help us please help us she started repeating the sentence with variations for the next several seconds and it was here that takk recognized a situation similar to another prophecy—or if not an exact situation at least a situation where one of dwelliris exhortation stanzas could certainly apply lo the lamb stands not alone but with those who see themselves within it he who helps the lamb helps himself he who serves the lamb saves himself dwellin wrote this particular stanza at a time when andrea hayterross experimented with holding back the pitiful allowance she provided him just to see what he would do dwellin wrote this stanza among others vaguely hinting that it was good to serve the lamb at the last minute prior to sending them to hayterross he excised one of the more desperate ones in which he flatout asked for cash and was also shortly thereafter arrested at a vons supermarket for stealing a clark bar hayterross paid his bail and in one of the rare moments where she felt bad about making dwellin jump through silly hoops gave him a bonus on his cash installment and took him out to dinner at a smorgasbord takk knew nothing of this backstory nor would it have mattered to him if he had what mattered to him was the lamb was asking for help—and that by asking for it had invited takk to help himself as well truth to be told takk was getting tired of the ftruu it was overwhelming and exciting and even a little gratifying at first—a nice adventure and an interesting way to see the universe but over the last few months and especially the last few days what takk mostly felt was tired tired of living with the criminal element which was not an especially invigorating element in any meaningful sense tired of feeling the obligation of trying forbidden things tired of meeting new people only in circumstances where he beat them or ate them in other words takk was primed for a religious epiphany and as he watched acuna jam his boot into creeks face one hammered into him with lightninghot intensity his time of ftruu was over suddenly and irrevocably and thank god for that it was time for him to make the choice to return to the ranks of the moral and to those engaged in the process of bettering the universe not destroying it as a way to get they wanted people like the nidu ambassador or the human jean schroeder or even rod acuna who didnt actually want much of anything other than to be angry and get paid for it acuna lifted his gun again to aim at creeks head robin turned into takks chest to avoid the scene still whispering for help with one enormous paw takk swiftly but gently moved robin aside stepped forward opened his insides and sent his intestinal tendrils whipping toward acuna one hooked acunas arm just as he fired his gun twisting the barrel to the right and ricocheting the bullet off the concrete floor into the wall the gun flew from the surprised acunas hand other tendrils hooked and wrapped around acunas legs waist and neck in less than a second acuna was secured in takks constrictive grip acuna nevertheless managed to crane his neck takks tendril hooks tearing his flesh as he did so to get a glimpse of the nagch what the fuck axe you doing acuna managed to croak out im serving the lamb takk replied and with a mighty jerk swallowed acuna whole    holy christ brian said to creek who was sitting at the comm centers terminal what the hell happened to you you look worse than usual lets skip the pleasantries creek said just tell me whats going on brian did catching up creek with tales of lawsuits usurpations church schemes and intelligent computers waging the barde of pajmhi over and over and over and over and then he told creek what he learned from andrea hayterross creek sighed and put his head into his right hand you look tired brian said i look like ive been shot in the arm and kicked in the face creek said that too brian said but i meant besides mat i am tired creek said i want this whole thing to go away its not going to go away brian said as gently as he could you know that i know creek said but im telling you what brian the next time your brother comes to me asking me to run a computer search for him im going to punch his goddamn lights out where is he by the way hes on the way to nidu with the secretary of state for the coronation for whomever it will be for whenever it may happen wheres robin shes outside talking to a new friend of hers creek said or should i say a new follower creek outlined the events of the last several minutes never a dull moment with you around brian said despite my preference to the contrary creek said are you sure shes safe with that thing brian said he could have let acuna kill me and take her creek said if he wanted to do anything bad to her that would have been the time i also gave her acunas gun how is the neverland shes safe brian said safe as can be expected anyway the british columbia is keeping the nidu off of her and the nidu are keeping the british columbia from sending a shuttle to pick you up everyone up there has taken the safety off the trigger but theyre keeping their iron in the holster i think theyre waiting to hear about you and robin creek sighed yeah he said im going out to talk to her now shes going to like all of this even less than i do its the only thing that will work brian said and it will work well make it work creek smiled we better he said dont go anywhere brian ill be right back ill be here brian said creek got up gingerly so as not to bump his injured arm which was now in a sling at robins request takk had gone to the pod and retrieved the first aid kit creek went outside to see robin and takk standing and talking seeing him approach robin turned to creek and smiled tell me you got everything to work she said everything works creek said and turned to takk would you excuse us for a moment takk i need to talk robin for a minute takk reached over and touched robin on the arm well talk about this some more later he said robin squeezed his paw id really like that she said takk departed nice to have a fan club creek said no kidding robin said although all this stuff about the evolved lamb makes me nervous takk seems really nice—as nice as you can be and eat people i mean—but i hope hes not going to be too upset when he eventually figures out im not some sort of mystical creature hold that thought creek said because there have been some interesting developments yeah robin said they cant be any stranger than hearing that youre supposed to be the divine object of worship robin creek said do you trust me i mean do you really trust me trust me as in if i tell you something youd be willing to do it even if it seems irredeemably insane robin stared at creek for a minute then started laughing oh god harry she said finally since ive met you what have we done thats not been insane do you even realize how ridiculous your question is at this point so thats a yes creek said its a yes robin said i trust you with my life harry its worked for me so far so hit me with what youve got well lets start with the big one creek said youre your own nation robin considered that for a moment for your sake that had better not be a comment about the size of my ass she said    the shuttle landed inside the natural amphitheater and deposited narfwingetag and jean schroeder whose relationship to the nidu robin and creek had learned from takk the two approached creek and robin when takk stepped forward thats far enough takk said back off schroeder said remember that youre working for me takk leaned into schroeder i dont work for you any more little man he said takk robin said takk eased back from schroeder thank you takk she said are we going to play intimidation games all day narfwingetag said or are we going to get to our negotiations there is very little time and i am quite busy yes were well aware of how busy youve been creek said seeing that we spent some time earlier in the day avoiding some of your business and well done i must say narfwingetag said to creek you live up to your billing mr creek thats prime minister creek to you ambassador creek said is it now narfwingetag said bemused well isnt this interesting an entire nation right here in front me all two of you three takk said but of course narfwingetag said three it is and i suppose youre the minister of defense its funny that you mock us robin said considering that from what i hear you were the reason this little nation exists you are quite right miss baker narfwingetag said or is it queen robin by all means i dont wish to violate protocol by addressing you incorrectly miss baker is fine robin said well then miss baker if you know that you are your own nation then you may also know that my nation is at war with yours narfwingetag said considering we outnumber your nation by about three billion to one thats not good news for you i thought we werent going to play intimidation games ambassador creek said my apologies narfwingetag said by all means lets get to it im going to make this simple creek said you want to take the crown of nidu your flunky here—creek motioned to jean schroeder—wants the earth you need robin to make it happen thats not quite true narfwingetag said i can make it happen without her help it will just be… messier and not guaranteed creek said whereas with her your ascension is uncontested and incontestable yes narfwingetag said you realize now theres no way you can take her by force creek said i would prefer to say that at this point it is impractical to do so narfwingetag said however you want to say it these are the facts before us creek said so lets make a deal we—all three of us—are willing to accompany you to nidu in your ship when we arrive at nidu robin will take part in the ceremony to crown a new fehen but there are four conditions name them narfwingetag said condition one creek said call off the war on robin what is bayesian statistics you may be wondering what all this bayesian stuff is if you’ve ever taken a statistics class it was likely based on frequentist statistics frequentist statistics is founded on the idea that probability represents the frequency with which something happens if the probability of getting heads in a single coin toss is 05 that means after a single coin toss we can expect to get onehalf of a head of a coin with two tosses we can expect to get one head which makes more sense bayesian statistics on the other hand is concerned with how probabilities represent how uncertain we are about a piece of information in bayesian terms if the probability of getting heads in a coin toss is 05 that means we are equally unsure about whether we’ll get heads or tails for problems like coin tosses both frequentist and bayesian approaches seem reasonable but when you’re quantifying your belief that your favorite candidate will win the next election the bayesian interpretation makes much more sense after all there’s only one election so speaking about how frequently your favorite candidate will win doesn’t make much sense when doing bayesian statistics we’re just trying to accurately describe what we believe about the world given the information we have one particularly nice thing about bayesian statistics is that because we can view it simply as reasoning about uncertain things all of the tools and techniques of bayesian statistics make intuitive sense bayesian statistics is about looking at a problem you face figuring out how you want to describe it mathematically and then using reason to solve it there are no mysterious tests that give results that you aren’t quite sure of no distributions you have to memorize and no traditional experiment designs you must perfectly replicate whether you want to figure out the probability that a new web page design will bring you more customers if your favorite sports team will win the next game or if we really are alone in the universe bayesian statistics will allow you to start reasoning about these things mathematically using just a few simple rules and a new way of looking at problems what’s in this book here’s a quick breakdown of what you’ll find in this book part i introduction to probability chapter 1 bayesian thinking and everyday reasoning this first chapter introduces you to bayesian thinking and shows you how similar it is to everyday methods of thinking critically about a situation we’ll explore the probability that a bright light outside your window at night is a ufo based on what you already know and believe about the world chapter 2 measuring uncertainty in this chapter you’ll use coin toss examples to assign actual values to your uncertainty in the form of probabilities a number from 0 to 1 that represents how certain you are in your belief about something chapter 3 the logic of uncertainty in logic we use and not and or operators to combine true or false facts it turns out that probability has similar notions of these operators we’ll investigate how to reason about the best mode of transport to get to an appointment and the chances of you getting a traffic ticket chapter 4 creating a binomial probability distribution using the rules of probability as logic in this chapter you’ll build your own probability distribution the binomial distribution which you can apply to many probability problems that share a similar structure you’ll try to predict the probability of getting a specific famous statistician collectable card in a gacha card game chapter 5 the beta distribution here you’ll learn about your first continuous probability distribution and get an introduction to what makes statistics different from probability the practice of statistics involves trying to figure out what unknown probabilities might be based on data in this chapter’s example we’ll investigate a mysterious coindispensing box and the chances of making more money than you lose part ii bayesian probability and prior probabilities chapter 6 conditional probability in this chapter you’ll condition probabilities based on your existing information for example knowing whether someone is male or female tells us how likely they are to be color blind you’ll also be introduced to bayes’ theorem which allows us to reverse conditional probabilities chapter 7 bayes’ theorem with lego here you’ll gain a better intuition for bayes’ theorem by reasoning about lego bricks this chapter will give you a spatial sense of what bayes’ theorem is doing mathematically chapter 8 the prior likelihood and posterior of bayes’ theorem bayes’ theorem is typically broken into three parts each of which performs its own function in bayesian reasoning in this chapter you’ll learn what they’re called and how to use them by investigating whether an apparent breakin was really a crime or just a series of coincidences chapter 9 bayesian priors and working with probability distributions this chapter explores how we can use bayes’ theorem to better understand the classic asteroid scene from star wars the empire strikes back through which you’ll gain a stronger understanding of prior probabilities in bayesian statistics you’ll also see how you can use entire distributions as your prior part iii parameter estimation chapter 10 introduction to averaging and parameter estimation parameter estimation is the method we use to formulate a best guess for an uncertain value the most basic tool in parameter estimation is to simply average your observations in this chapter we’ll see why this works by analyzing snowfall levels chapter 11 measuring the spread of our data finding the mean is a useful first step in estimating parameters but we also need a way to account for how spread out our observations are here you’ll be introduced to mean absolute deviation mad variance and standard deviation as ways to measure how spread out our observations are chapter 12 the normal distribution by combining our mean and standard deviation we get a very useful distribution for making estimates the normal distribution in this chapter you’ll learn how to use the normal distribution to not only estimate unknown values but also to know how certain you are in those estimates you’ll use these new skills to time your escape during a bank heist chapter 13 tools of parameter estimation the pdf cdf and quantile function here you’ll learn about the pdf cdf and quantile function to better understand the parameter estimations you’re making you’ll estimate email conversion rates using these tools and see what insights each provides chapter 14 parameter estimation with prior probabilities the best way to improve our parameter estimates is to include a prior probability in this chapter you’ll see how adding prior information about the past success of email clickthrough rates can help us better estimate the true conversion rate for a new email chapter 15 from parameter estimation to hypothesis testing building a bayesian ab test now that we can estimate uncertain values we need a way to compare two uncertain values in order to test a hypothesis you’ll create an ab test to determine how confident you are in a new method of email marketing part iv hypothesis testing the heart of statistics chapter 16 introduction to the bayes factor and posterior odds the competition of ideas ever stay up late browsing the web wondering if you might have a superrare disease this chapter will introduce another approach to testing ideas that will help you determine how worried you should actually be chapter 17 bayesian reasoning in the twilight zone how much do you believe in psychic powers in this chapter you’ll develop your own mindreading skills by analyzing a situation from a classic episode of the twilight zone chapter 18 when data doesn’t convince you sometimes data doesn’t seem to be enough to change someone’s mind about a belief or help you win an argument learn how you can change a friend’s mind about something you disagree on and why it’s not worth your time to argue with your belligerent uncle chapter 19 from hypothesis testing to parameter estimation here we come full circle back to parameter estimation by looking at how to compare a range of hypotheses you’ll derive your first example of statistics the beta distribution using the tools that we’ve covered for simple hypothesis tests to analyze the fairness of a particular fairground game appendix a a quick introduction to r this quick appendix will teach you the basics of the r programming language appendix b enough calculus to get by here we’ll cover just enough calculus to get you comfortable with the math used in the book background for reading the book the only requirement of this book is basic high school algebra if you flip forward you’ll see a few instances of math but nothing particularly onerous we’ll be using a bit of code written in the r programming language which i’ll provide and talk through so there’s no need to have learned r beforehand we’ll also touch on calculus but again no prior experience is required and the appendixes will give you enough information to cover what you’ll need in other words this book aims to help you start thinking about problems in a mathematical way without requiring significant mathematical background when you finish reading it you may find yourself inadvertently writing down equations to describe problems you see in everyday life if you do happen to have a strong background in statistics even bayesian statistics i believe you’ll still have a fun time reading through this book i have always found that the best way to understand a field well is to revisit the fundamentals over and over again each time in a different light even as the author of this book i found plenty of things that surprised me just in the course of the writing process now off on your adventure as you’ll soon see aside from being very useful bayesian statistics can be a lot of fun to help you learn bayesian reasoning we’ll be taking a look at lego bricks the twilight zone star wars and more you’ll find that once you begin thinking probabilistically about problems you’ll start using bayesian statistics all over the place this book is designed to be a pretty quick and enjoyable read so turn the page and let’s begin our adventure in bayesian statistics part i introduction to probability 1 bayesian thinking and everyday reasoning in this first chapter i’ll give you an overview of bayesian reasoning the formal process we use to update our beliefs about the world once we’ve observed some data we’ll work through a scenario and explore how we can map our everyday experience to bayesian reasoning the good news is that you were already a bayesian even before you picked up this book bayesian statistics is closely aligned with how people naturally use evidence to create new beliefs and reason about everyday problems the tricky part is breaking down this natural thought process into a rigorous mathematical one in statistics we use particular calculations and models to more accurately quantify probability for now though we won’t use any math or models we’ll just get you familiar with the basic concepts and use our intuition to determine probabilities then in the next chapter we’ll put exact numbers to probabilities throughout the rest of the book you’ll learn how we can use rigorous mathematical techniques to formally model and reason about the concepts we’ll cover in this chapter reasoning about strange experiences one night you are suddenly awakened by a bright light at your window you jump up from bed and look out to see a large object in the sky that can only be described as saucer shaped you are generally a skeptic and have never believed in alien encounters but completely perplexed by the scene outside you find yourself thinking could this be a ufo bayesian reasoning involves stepping through your thought process when you’re confronted with a situation to recognize when you’re making probabilistic assumptions and then using those assumptions to update your beliefs about the world in the ufo scenario you’ve already gone through a full bayesian analysis because you 1 observed data 2 formed a hypothesis 3 updated your beliefs based on the data this reasoning tends to happen so quickly that you don’t have any time to analyze your own thinking you created a new belief without questioning it whereas before you did not believe in the existence of ufos after the event you’ve updated your beliefs and now think you’ve seen a ufo in this chapter you’ll focus on structuring your beliefs and the process of creating them so you can examine it more formally and we’ll look at quantifying this process in chapters to come let’s look at each step of reasoning in turn starting with observing data observing data founding your beliefs on data is a key component of bayesian reasoning before you can draw any conclusions about the scene such as claiming what you see is a ufo you need to understand the data you’re observing in this case  an extremely bright light outside your window  a saucershaped object hovering in the air based on your past experience you would describe what you saw out your window as surprising in probabilistic terms we could write this as pbright light outside window saucershaped object in sky very low where p denotes probability and the two pieces of data are listed inside the parentheses you would read this equation as the probability of observing bright lights outside the window and a saucershaped object in the sky is very low in probability theory we use a comma to separate events when we’re looking at the combined probability of multiple events note that this data does not contain anything specific about ufos it’s simply made up of your observations—this will be important later we can also examine probabilities of single events which would be written as prain likely this equation is read as the probability of rain is likely for our ufo scenario we’re determining the probability of both events occurring together the probability of one of these two events occurring on its own would be entirely different for example the bright lights alone could easily be a passing car so on its own the probability of this event is more likely than its probability coupled with seeing a saucershaped object and the saucershaped object would still be surprising even on its own so how are we determining this probability right now we’re using our intuition—that is our general sense of the likelihood of perceiving these events in the next chapter we’ll see how we can come up with exact numbers for our probabilities holding prior beliefs and conditioning probabilities you are able to wake up in the morning make your coffee and drive to work without doing a lot of analysis because you hold prior beliefs about how the world works our prior beliefs are collections of beliefs we’ve built up over a lifetime of experiences that is of observing data you believe that the sun will rise because the sun has risen every day since you were born likewise you might have a prior belief that when the light is red for oncoming traffic at an intersection and your light is green it’s safe to drive through the intersection without prior beliefs we would go to bed terrified each night that the sun might not rise tomorrow and stop at every intersection to carefully inspect oncoming traffic our prior beliefs say that seeing bright lights outside the window at the same time as seeing a saucershaped object is a rare occurrence on earth however if you lived on a distant planet populated by vast numbers of flying saucers with frequent interstellar visitors the probability of seeing lights and saucershaped objects in the sky would be much higher in a formula we enter prior beliefs after our data separated with a | like so   we would read this equation as the probability of observing bright lights and a saucershaped object in the sky given our experience on earth is very low the probability outcome is called a conditional probability because we are conditioning the probability of one event occurring on the existence of something else in this case we’re conditioning the probability of our observation on our prior experience in the same way we used p for probability we typically use shorter variable names for events and conditions if you’re unfamiliar with reading equations they can seem too terse at first after a while though you’ll find that shorter variable names aid readability and help you to see how equations generalize to larger classes of problems we’ll assign all of our data to a single variable d d bright light outside window saucershaped object in sky so from now on when we refer to the probability of set of data we’ll simply say p d likewise we use the variable x to represent our prior belief like so x experience on earth we can now write this equation as p d | x this is much easier to write and doesn’t change the meaning conditioning on multiple beliefs we can add more than one piece of prior knowledge too if more than one variable is going to significantly affect the probability suppose that it’s july 4th and you live in the united states from prior experience you know that fireworks are common on the fourth of july given your experience on earth and the fact that it’s july 4th the probability of seeing lights in the sky is less unlikely and even the saucershaped object could be related to some fireworks display you could rewrite this equation as taking both these experiences into account our conditional probability changed from very low to low assuming prior beliefs in practice in statistics we don’t usually explicitly include a condition for all of our existing experiences because it can be assumed for that reason in this book we won’t include a separate variable for this condition however in bayesian analysis it’s essential to keep in mind that our understanding of the world is always conditioned on our prior experience in the world for the rest of this chapter we’ll keep the experience on earth variable around to remind us of this forming a hypothesis so far we have our data d that we have seen a bright light and a saucershaped object and our prior experience x in order to explain what you saw you need to form some kind of hypothesis—a model about how the world works that makes a prediction hypotheses can come in many forms all of our basic beliefs about the world are hypotheses  if you believe the earth rotates you predict the sun will rise and set at certain times  if you believe that your favorite baseball team is the best you predict they will win more than the other teams  if you believe in astrology you predict that the alignment of the stars will describe people and events hypotheses can also be more formal or sophisticated  a scientist may hypothesize that a certain treatment will slow the growth of cancer  a quantitative analyst in finance may have a model of how the market will behave  a deep neural network may predict which images are animals and which ones are plants all of these examples are hypotheses because they have some way of understanding the world and use that understanding to make a prediction about how the world will behave when we think of hypotheses in bayesian statistics we are usually concerned with how well they predict the data we observe when you see the evidence and think a ufo you are forming a hypothesis the ufo hypothesis is likely based on countless movies and television shows you’ve seen in your prior experience we would define our first hypothesis as h 1 a ufo is in my back yard but what is this hypothesis predicting if we think of this situation backward we might ask if there was a ufo in your back yard what would you expect to see and you might answer bright lights and a saucershaped object because h 1 predicts the data d when we observe our data given our hypothesis the probability of the data increases formally we write this as p d| h 1 x p d| x this equation says the probability of seeing bright lights and a saucershaped object in the sky given my belief that this is a ufo and my prior experience is much higher indicated by the double greaterthan sign  than just seeing bright lights and a saucershaped object in the sky without explanation here we’ve used the language of probability to demonstrate that our hypothesis explains the data spotting hypotheses in everyday speech it’s easy to see a relationship between our everyday language and probability saying something is surprising for example might be the same as saying it has lowprobability data based on our prior experiences saying something makes sense might indicate we have highprobability data based on our prior experiences this may seem obvious once pointed out but the key to probabilistic reasoning is to think carefully about how you interpret data create hypotheses and change your beliefs even in an ordinary everyday scenario without h 1 you’d be in a state of confusion because you have no explanation for the data you observed gathering more evidence and updating your beliefs now you have your data and a hypothesis however given your prior experience as a skeptic that hypothesis still seems pretty outlandish in order to improve your state of knowledge and draw  more reliable conclusions you need to collect more data this is the next step in statistical reasoning as well as in your own intuitive thinking to collect more data we need to make more observations in our scenario you look out your window to see what you can observe as you look toward the bright light outside you notice more lights in the area you also see that the large saucershaped object is held up by wires and notice a camera crew you hear a loud clap and someone call out cut you have very likely instantly changed your mind about what you think is happening in this scene your inference before was that you might be witnessing a ufo now with this new evidence you realize it looks more like someone is shooting a movie nearby with this thought process your brain has once again performed some sophisticated bayesian analysis in an instant let’s break down what happened in your head in order to reason about events more carefully you started with your initial hypothesis h 1 a ufo has landed in isolation this hypothesis given your experience is extremely unlikely p h 1 | x very very low however it was the only useful explanation you could come up with given the data you had available when you observed additional data you immediately realized that there’s another possible hypothesis—that a movie is being filmed nearby h 2 a film is being made outside your window in isolation the probability of this hypothesis is also intuitively very low unless you happen to live near a movie studio p h 2 | x very low notice that we set the probability of h 1 as very very low and the probability of h 2 as just very low this corresponds to your intuition if someone came up to you without any data and asked which do you think is more likely a ufo appearing at night in your neighborhood or a movie being filmed next door you would say the movie scenario is more likely than a ufo appearance now we just need a way to take our new data into account when changing our beliefs comparing hypotheses you first accepted the ufo hypothesis despite it being unlikely because you didn’t initially have any other explanation now however there’s another possible explanation—a movie being filmed—so you have formed an alternate hypothesis considering alternate hypotheses is the process of comparing multiple theories using the data you have when you see the wires film crew and additional lights your data changes your updated data are  on observing this extra data you change your conclusion about what was happening let’s break this process down into bayesian reasoning your first hypothesis h 1 gave you a way to explain your data and end your confusion but with your additional observations h 1 no longer explains the data well we can write this as p d updated | h 1 x very very low you now have a new hypothesis h 2 which explains the data much better written as follows p d updated | h 2 x p d updated | h 1 x the key here is to understand that we’re comparing how well each of these hypotheses explains the observed data when we say the probability of the data given the second hypothesis is much greater than the first we’re saying that what we observed is better explained by the second hypothesis this brings us to the true heart of bayesian analysis the test of your beliefs is how well they explain the world we say that one belief is more accurate than another because it provides a better explanation of the world we observe mathematically we express this idea as the ratio of the two probabilities when this ratio is a large number say 1000 it means h 2 explains the data 1000 times better than h 1 because h 2 explains the data many times better than another h 1 we update our beliefs from h 1 to h 2 this is exactly what happened when you changed your mind about the likely explanation for what you observed you now believe that what you’ve seen is a movie being made outside your window because this is a more likely explanation of all the data you observed data informs belief belief should not inform data one final point worth stressing is that the only absolute in all these examples is your data your hypotheses change and your experience in the world x may be different from someone else’s but the data d is shared by all consider the following two formulas the first is one we’ve used throughout this chapter p d | h x which we read as the probability of the data given my hypotheses and experience in the world or more plainly how well my beliefs explain what i observe but there is a reversal of this common in everyday thinking which is p h | d x we read this as the probability of my beliefs given the data and my experiences in the world or how well what i observe supports what i believe in the first case we change our beliefs according to data we gather and observations we make about the world that describe it better in the second case we gather data to support our existing beliefs bayesian thinking is about changing your mind and updating how you understand the  world the data we observe is all that is real so our beliefs ultimately need to shift until they align with the data in life too your beliefs should always be mutable as the film crew packs up you notice that all the vans bear military insignia the crew takes off their coats to reveal army fatigues and you overhear someone say well that should have fooled anyone who saw that  good thinking with this new evidence your beliefs may shift again wrapping up let’s recap what you’ve learned your beliefs start with your existing experience of the world x when you observe data d it either aligns with your experience p d | x very high or it surprises you p d | x very low to understand the world you rely on beliefs you have about what you observe or hypotheses h oftentimes a new hypothesis can help you explain the data that surprises you p d | h x p d | x when you gather new data or come up with new ideas you can create more hypotheses h 1 h 2 h 3  you update your beliefs when a new hypothesis explains your data much better than your old hypothesis finally you should be far more concerned with data changing your beliefs than with ensuring data supports your beliefs p h | d with these foundations set up you’re ready to start adding numbers into the mix in the rest of part i you’ll model your beliefs mathematically to precisely determine how and when you should change them exercises try answering the following questions to see how well you understand bayesian reasoning the solutions can be found at httpsnostarchcomlearnbayes 1 rewrite the following statements as equations using the mathematical notation you learned in this chapter  the probability of rain is low  the probability of rain given that it is cloudy is high  the probability of you having an umbrella given it is raining is much greater than the probability of you having an umbrella in general 2 organize the data you observe in the following scenario into a mathematical notation using the techniques we’ve covered in this chapter then come up with a hypothesis to explain this data you come home from work and notice that your front door is open and the side window is broken as you walk inside you immediately notice that your laptop is missing 3 the following scenario adds data to the previous one demonstrate how this new information changes your beliefs and come up with a second hypothesis to explain the data using the notation you’ve learned in this chapter a neighborhood child runs up to you and apologizes profusely for accidentally throwing a rock through your window they claim that they saw the laptop and didn’t want it stolen so they opened the front door to grab it and your laptop is safe at their house  2 measuring uncertainty in chapter 1 we looked at some basic reasoning tools we use intuitively to understand how data informs our beliefs we left a crucial issue unresolved how can we quantify these tools in probability theory rather than describing beliefs with terms like very low and high we need to assign real numbers to these beliefs this allows us to create quantitative models of our understanding of the world with these models we can see just how much the evidence changes our beliefs decide when we should change our thinking and gain a solid understanding of our current state of knowledge in this chapter we will apply this concept to quantify the probability of an event what is a probability the idea of probability is deeply ingrained in our everyday language whenever you say something such as that seems unlikely or i would be surprised if that’s not the case or i’m not sure about that you’re making a claim about probability probability is a measurement of how strongly we believe things about the world in the previous chapter we used abstract qualitative terms to describe our beliefs to really analyze how we develop and change beliefs we need to define exactly what a probability is by more formally quantifying p x—that is how strongly we believe in x we can consider probability an extension of logic in basic logic we have two values true and false which correspond to absolute beliefs when we say something is true it means that we are completely certain it is the case while logic is useful for many problems very rarely do we believe anything to be absolutely true or absolutely false there is almost always some level of uncertainty in every decision we make probability allows us to extend logic to work with uncertain values between true and false computers commonly represent true as 1 and false as 0 and we can use this model with probability as well p x 0 is the same as saying that x false and p x 1 is the same as x true between 0 and 1 we have an infinite range of possible values a value closer to 0 means we are more certain that something is false and a value closer to 1 means we’re more certain something is true it’s worth noting that a value of 05 means that we are completely unsure whether something is true or false another important part of logic is negation when we say not true we mean false likewise saying not false means true we want probability to work the same way so we make sure that the   probability of x and the negation of the probability of x sum to 1 in other words values are either x or not x we can express this using the following equation p x ¬ p x 1 note the ¬ symbol means negation or not using this logic we can always find the negation of p x by subtracting it from 1 so for example if p x 1 then its negation 1 – p x must equal 0 conforming to our basic logic rules and if p x  0 then its negation 1 – p x 1 the next question is how to quantify that uncertainty we could arbitrarily pick values say 095 means very certain and 005 means very uncertain however this doesn’t help us determine probability much more than the abstract terms we’ve used before instead we need to use formal methods to calculate our probabilities calculating probabilities by counting outcomes of events the most common way to calculate probability is to count outcomes of events we have two sets of outcomes that are important the first is all possible outcomes of an event for a coin toss this would be heads or tails the second is the count of the outcomes you’re interested in if you’ve decided that heads means you win the outcomes you care about are those involving heads in the case of a single coin toss just one event the events you’re interested in can be anything flipping a coin and getting heads catching the flu or a ufo landing outside your bedroom given these two sets of outcomes—ones you’re interested in and ones you’re not interested in—all we care about is the ratio of outcomes we’re interested in to the total number of possible outcomes we’ll use the simple example of a coin flip where the only possible outcomes are the coin landing on heads or landing on tails the first step is to make a count of all the possible events which in this case is only two heads or tails in probability theory we use ω the capital greek letter omega to indicate the set of all events ω heads tails we want to know the probability of getting a heads in a single coin toss written as pheads we therefore look at the number of outcomes we care about 1 and divide that by the total number of possible outcomes 2 for a single coin toss we can see that there is one outcome we care about out of two possible outcomes so the probability of heads is just now let’s ask a trickier question what is the probability of getting at least one heads when we toss two coins our list of possible events is more complicated it’s not just heads tails but rather all possible pairs of heads and tails ω heads headsheads tailstails tailstails heads to figure out the probability of getting at least one heads we look at how many of our pairs match our condition which in this case is heads headsheads tailstails heads as you can see the set of events we care about has 3 elements and there are 4 possible pairs we could get this means that pat least one heads 34 these are simple examples but if you can count the events you care about and the total possible events you can come up with a quick and easy probability as you can imagine as examples get more complicated manually counting each possible outcome becomes unfeasible solving harder probability problems of this nature often involves a field of mathematics called combinatorics in chapter 4 we’ll see how we can use combinatorics to solve a slightly more complex problem calculating probabilities as ratios of beliefs counting events is useful for physical objects but it’s not so great for the vast majority of reallife probability questions we might have such as  what’s the probability it will rain tomorrow  do you think she’s the president of the company  is that a ufo nearly every day you make countless decisions based on probability but if someone asked you to solve how likely do think you are to make your train on time you couldn’t calculate it with the method just described this means we need another approach to probability that can be used to reason about these more abstract problems as an example suppose you’re chatting about random topics with a friend your friend asks if you’ve heard of the mandela effect and since you haven’t proceeds to tell you it’s this weird thing where large groups of people misremember events for example many people recall nelson mandela dying in prison in the 80s but the wild thing is that he was released from prison became president of south africa and didn’t die until 2013 skeptically you turn to your friend and say that sounds like internet pop psychology i don’t think anyone seriously misremembered that i bet there’s not even a wikipedia entry on it from this you want to measure pno wikipedia article on mandela effect let’s assume you are in an area with no cell phone reception so you can’t quickly verify the answer you have a high certainty of your belief that there is no such article and therefore you want to assign a high probability for this belief but you need to formalize that probability by assigning it a number from 0 to 1 where do you start you decide to put your money where your mouth is telling your friend there’s no way that’s real how about this you give me 5 if there is no article on the mandela effect and i’ll give you 100 if there is one making bets is a practical way that we can express how strongly we hold our beliefs you believe that the article’s existence is so unlikely that you’ll give your friend 100 if you are wrong and only get 5 from them if you are right because we’re talking about quantitative values regarding our beliefs we can start to figure out an exact probability for your belief that there is no wikipedia article on the mandela effect  using odds to determine probability your friend’s hypothesis is that there is an article about the mandela effect h article and you have an alternate hypothesis h no article we don’t have concrete probabilities yet but your bet expresses how strongly you believe in your hypothesis by giving the odds of the bet odds are a common way to represent beliefs as a ratio of how much you would be willing to pay if you were wrong about the outcome of an event to how much you’d want to receive for being correct for example say the odds of a horse winning a race are 12 to 1 that means if you pay 1 to take the bet the track will pay you 12 if the horse wins while odds are commonly expressed as m to n we can also view them as a simple ratio m n there is a direct relationship between odds and probabilities we can express your bet in terms of odds as 100 to 5 so how can we turn this into probability your odds represent how many times more strongly you believe there isn’t an article than you believe there is an article we can write this as the ratio of your belief in there being no article p h no article to your friend’s belief that there is one p h article like so from the ratio of these two hypotheses we can see that your belief in the hypothesis that there is no article is 20 times greater than your belief in your friend’s hypothesis we can use this fact to work out the exact probability for your hypothesis using some high school algebra solving for the probabilities we start writing our equation in terms of the probability of your hypothesis since this is what we are interested in knowing p h no article 20 × p h article we can read this equation as the probability that there is no article is 20 times greater than the probability there is an article there are only two possibilities either there is a wikipedia article on the mandela effect or there isn’t because our two hypotheses cover all possibilities we know that the probability of an article is just 1 minus the probability of no article so we can substitute p h article with its value in terms of p h no article in our equation like so p h no article 20 × 1 – p h article next we can expand 20 × 1 – p h no article by multiplying both parts in the parentheses by 20 and we get p h no article 20 – 20 × p h no article we can remove the p h no article term from the right side of the equation by adding 20 × p h no article to both sides to isolate p h no article on the left side of the equation 21 × p h no article 20 and we can divide both sides by 21 finally arriving at      now you have a nice clearly defined value between 0 and 1 to assign as a concrete quantitative probability to your belief in the hypothesis that there is no article on the mandela effect we can generalize this process of converting odds to probability using the following equation often in practice when you’re confronted with assigning a probability to an abstract belief it can be very helpful to think of how much you would bet on that belief you would likely take a billion to 1 bet that the sun will rise tomorrow but you might take much lower odds for your favorite baseball team winning in either case you can calculate an exact number for the probability of that belief using the steps we just went through measuring beliefs in a coin toss we now have a method for determining the probability of abstract ideas using odds but the real test of the robustness of this method is whether or not it still works with our coin toss which we calculated by counting outcomes rather than thinking about a coin toss as an event we can rephrase the question as how strongly do i believe the next coin toss will be heads now we’re not talking about pheads but rather a hypothesis or belief about the coin toss p h heads just like before we need an alternate hypothesis to compare our belief with we could say the alternate hypothesis is simply not getting heads h¬heads but the option of getting tails h tails is closer to our everyday language so we’ll use that at the end of the day what we care about most is making sense however it is important for this discussion to acknowledge that h tails h¬heads and p h tails 1 – p h heads we can look at how to model our beliefs as the ratio between these competing hypotheses remember that we want to read this as how many times greater do i believe that the outcome will be heads than i do that it will be tails as far as bets go since each outcome is equally uncertain the only fair odds are 1 to 1 of course we can pick any odds as long as the two values are equal 2 to 2 5 to 5 or 10 to 10 all of these have the same ratio given that the ratio of these is always the same we can simply repeat the process we used to calculate the probability of there being no wikipedia article on the mandela effect we know that our probability of heads and probability of tails must sum to 1 and we know that the ratio of these two probabilities is also 1 so we have two equations that describe our probabilities if you walk through the process we used when reasoning about the mandela effect solving in terms of p h heads you should find the only possible solution to this problem is 12 this is exactly the same result we arrived at with our first approach to calculating probabilities of events and it proves that our method for calculating the probability of a belief is robust enough to use for the probability of events with these two methods in hand it’s reasonable to ask which one you should use in which situation the good news is since we can see they are equivalent you can use whichever method is easiest for a given problem wrapping up in this chapter we explored two different types of probabilities those of events and those of beliefs we define probability as the ratio of the outcomes we care about to the number of all possible outcomes while this is the most common definition of probability it is difficult to apply to beliefs because most practical everyday probability problems do not have clearcut outcomes and so aren’t intuitively assigned discrete numbers to calculate the probability of beliefs then we need to establish how many times more we believe in one hypothesis over another one good test of this is how much you would be willing to bet on your belief—for example if you made a bet with a friend in which you’d give them 1000 for proof that ufos exist and would receive only 1 from them for proof that ufos don’t exist here you are saying you believe ufos do not exist 1000 times more than you believe they do exist with these tools in hand you can calculate the probability for a wide range of problems in the next chapter you’ll learn how you can apply the basic operators of logic and and or to our probabilities but before moving on try using what you’ve learned in this chapter to complete the following exercises exercises try answering the following questions to make sure you understand how we can assign real values between 0 and 1 to our beliefs solutions to the questions can be found at httpsnostarchcomlearnbayes 1 what is the probability of rolling two sixsided dice and getting a value greater than 7 2 what is the probability of rolling three sixsided dice and getting a value greater than 7 3 the yankees are playing the red sox you’re a diehard sox fan and bet your friend they’ll win the game you’ll pay your friend 30 if the sox lose and your friend will have to pay you only 5 if the sox win what is the probability you have intuitively assigned to the belief that the red sox will win  3 the logic of uncertainty in chapter 2 we discussed how probabilities are an extension of the true and false values in logic and are expressed as values between 1 and 0 the power of probability is in the ability to express an infinite range of possible values between these extremes in this chapter we’ll discuss how the rules of logic based on these logical operators also apply to probability in traditional logic there are three important operators  and  or  not with these three simple operators we can reason about any argument in traditional logic for example consider this statement if it is raining and i am going outside i will need an umbrella this statement contains just one logical operator and because of this operator we know that if it’s true that it is raining and it is true that i am going outside i’ll need an umbrella we can also phrase this statement in terms of our other operators if it is not raining or if i am not going outside i will not need an umbrella in this case we are using basic logical operators and facts to make a decision about when we do and don’t need an umbrella however this type of logical reasoning works well only when our facts have absolute true or false values this case is about deciding whether i need an umbrella right now so we can know for certain if it’s currently raining and whether i’m going out and therefore i can easily determine if i need an umbrella suppose instead we ask will i need an umbrella tomorrow in this case our facts become uncertain because the weather forecast gives me only a probability for rain tomorrow and i may be uncertain whether or not i need to go out this chapter will explain how we can extend our three logical operators to work with probability allowing us to reason about uncertain information the same way we can with facts in traditional logic we’ve already seen how we can define not for probabilistic reasoning ¬ p x 1 – p x in the rest of this chapter we’ll see how we can use the two remaining operators and and or to combine probabilities and give us more accurate and useful data   combining probabilities with and in statistics we use and to talk about the probability of combined events for example the probability of  rolling a 6 and flipping a heads  it raining and you forgetting your umbrella  winning the lottery and getting struck by lightning to understand how we can define and for probability we’ll start with a simple example involving a coin and a sixsided die solving a combination of two probabilities suppose we want to know the probability of getting a heads in a coin flip and rolling a 6 on a die we know that the probability of each of these events individually is now we want to know the probability of both of these things occurring written as pheads six  we can calculate this the same way we did in chapter 2 we count the outcomes we care about and divide that by the total outcomes for this example let’s imagine these events happening in sequence when we flip the coin we have two possible outcomes heads and tails as depicted in figure 31 figure 31 visualizing the two possible outcomes from a coin toss as distinct paths now for each possible coin flip there are six possible results for the roll of our die as depicted in figure 32   figure 32 visualizing the possible outcomes from a coin toss and the roll of a die using this visualization we can just count our possible solutions there are 12 possible outcomes of flipping a coin and rolling a die and we care about only one of these outcomes so now we have a solution for this particular problem however what we really want is a general rule that will help us calculate this for any number of probability combinations let’s see how to expand our solution applying the product rule of probability we’ll use the same problem for this example what is the probability of flipping a heads and rolling a 6 first we need to figure out the probability of flipping a heads looking at our branching paths we can figure out how many paths split off given the probabilities we care only about the paths that include heads because the probability of heads is 12 we eliminate half of our possibilities then if we look only at the remaining branch of possibilities for the heads we can see that there is only a 16 chance of getting the result we want rolling a 6 on a sixsided die in figure 33 we can visualize this reasoning and see that there is only one outcome we care about   figure 33 visualizing the probability of both getting a heads and rolling a 6 if we multiply these two probabilities we can see that this is exactly the answer we had before but rather than counting all possible events we counted only the probabilities of the events we care about by following along the branches this is easy enough to do visually for such a simple problem but the real value of showing you this is that it illustrates a general rule for combining probabilities with and p a b p a × p b because we are multiplying our results also called taking the product of these results we refer to this as the product rule of probability this rule can then be expanded to include more probabilities if we think of p a b as a single probability we can combine it with a third probability p c by repeating this process p p a b c p a b × p c p a × p b × p c so we can use our product rule to combine an unlimited number of events to get our final probability example calculating the probability of being late let’s look at an example of using the product rule for a slightly more complex problem than rolling dice or flipping coins suppose you promised to meet a friend for coffee at 430 on the other side of town and you plan to take public transportation it’s currently 330 thankfully the station you’re at has both a train and bus that can take you where you need to go  the next bus comes at 345 and takes 45 minutes to get you to the coffee shop  the next train comes at 350 and will get you within a 10minute walk in 30 minutes both the train and the bus will get you there at 430 exactly because you’re cutting it so close any delay will make you late the good news is that since the bus arrives before the train if the bus is late and the train is not you’ll still be on time if the bus is on time and the train is late you’ll also be fine the only situation that will make you late is if both the bus and the train are late to arrive how can you figure out the probability of being late first you need to establish the probability of both the train being late and the bus being late let’s assume the local transit authority publishes these numbers later in the book you’ll learn how to estimate this from data platetrain 015 platebus 02 the published data tells us that 15 percent of the time the train is late and 20 percent of the time the bus is late since you’ll be late only if both the bus and the train are late we can use the product rule to solve this problem plate platetrain × platebus 015 × 02 003 even though there’s a pretty reasonable chance that either the bus or the train will be late the probability that they will both be late is significantly less at only 003 we can also say there is a 3 percent chance that both will be late with this calculation done you can be a little less stressed about being late     combining probabilities with or the other essential rule of logic is combining probabilities with or some examples of which include  catching the flu or getting a cold  flipping a heads on a coin or rolling a 6 on a die  getting a flat tire or running out of gas the probability of one event or another event occurring is slightly more complicated because the events can either be mutually exclusive or not mutually exclusive events are mutually exclusive if one event happening implies the other possible events cannot happen for example the possible outcomes of rolling a die are mutually exclusive because a single roll cannot yield both a 1 and a 6 however say a baseball game will be cancelled if it is either raining or the coach is sick these events are not mutually exclusive because it is perfectly possible that the coach is sick and it rains calculating or for mutually exclusive events the process of combining two events with or feels logically intuitive if you’re asked what is the probability of getting heads or tails on a coin toss you would say 1 we know that intuitively we might just add the probability of these events together we know this works because heads and tails are the only possible outcomes and the probability of all possible outcomes must equal 1 if the probabilities of all possible events did not equal 1 then we would have some outcome that was missing so how do we know that there would need to be a missing outcome if the sum was less than 1 suppose we know that the probability of heads is pheads 12 but someone claimed that the probability of tails was ptails 13 we also know from before that the probability of not getting heads must be since the probability of not getting heads is 12 and the claimed probability for tails is only 13 either there is a missing event or our probability for tails is incorrect from this we can see that as long as events are mutually exclusive we can simply add up all of the probabilities of each possible event to get the probability of either event happening to calculate the probability of one event or the other another example of this is rolling a die we know that the probability of rolling a 1 is 16 and the same is true for rolling a 2 so we can perform the same operation adding the two probabilities and see that the combined probability of rolling either a 1 or a 2 is 26 or 13 again this makes intuitive sense this addition rule applies only to combinations of mutually exclusive outcomes in probabilistic terms mutually exclusive means that p a and p b 0 that is the probability of getting both a and b together is 0 we see that this holds for our examples  it is impossible to flip one coin and get both heads and tails  it is impossible to roll both a 1 and a 2 on a single roll of a die to really understand combining probabilities with or we need to look at the case where events are not mutually exclusive using the sum rule for non–mutually exclusive events again using the example of rolling a die and flipping a coin let’s look at the probability of either flipping heads or rolling a 6 many newcomers to probability may naively assume that adding probabilities will work in this case as well given that we know that pheads 12 and psix  16 it might initially seem plausible that the probability of either of these events is simply 46 it becomes obvious that this doesn’t work however when we consider the possibility of either flipping a heads or rolling a number less than 6 because pless than six 56 adding these probabilities together gives us 86 which is greater than 1 since this violates the rule that probabilities must be between 0 and 1 we must have made a mistake the trouble is that flipping a heads and rolling a 6 are not mutually exclusive as we know from earlier in the chapter pheads six 112 because the probability of both events happening at the same time is not 0 we know they are by definition not mutually exclusive the reason that adding our probabilities doesn’t work for non–mutually exclusive events is that doing so doubles the counting of events where both things happen as an example of overcounting let’s look at all of the outcomes of our combined coin toss and die roll that contain heads heads — 1 heads — 2 heads — 3 heads — 4 heads — 5 heads — 6 these outcomes represent 6 out of the 12 possible outcomes which we expect since pheads  12 now let’s look at all outcomes that include rolling a 6 heads — 6 tails — 6 these outcomes represent the 2 out of 12 possible outcomes that will result in us rolling a 6 which again we expect because psix 16 since there are six outcomes that satisfy the condition of flipping a heads and two that satisfy the condition of rolling a 6 we might be tempted to say that there are eight outcomes that represent getting either heads or rolling a 6 however we would be doublecounting because heads — 6 appears in both lists there are in fact only 7 out of 12 unique outcomes if we naively add pheads and psix we end up overcounting  to correct our probabilities we must add up all of our probabilities and then subtract the probability of both events occurring this leads us to the rule for combining non–mutually exclusive probabilities with or known as the sum rule of probability p a or p b p a p b – p a b we add the probability of each event happening and then subtract the probability of both events happening to ensure we are not counting these probabilities twice since they are a part of both p a and p b so using our die roll and coin toss example the probability of rolling a number less than 6 or flipping a heads is let’s take a look at a final or example to really cement this idea example calculating the probability of getting a hefty fine imagine a new scenario you were just pulled over for speeding while on a road trip you realize you haven’t been pulled over in a while and may have forgotten to put either your new registration or your new insurance card in the glove box if either one of these is missing you’ll get a more expensive ticket before you open the glove box how can you assign a probability that you’ll have forgotten one or the other of your cards and you’ll get the higher ticket you’re pretty confident that you put your registration in the car so you assign a 07 probability to your registration being in the car however you’re also pretty sure that you left your insurance card on the counter at home so you assign only a 02 chance that your new insurance card is in the car so we know that pregistration 07 pinsurance 02 however these values are the probabilities that you do have these things in the glove box you’re worried about whether either one is missing to get the probabilities of missing items we simply use negation pmissingreg 1 – pregistration 03 pmissingins 1 – pinsurance 08 if we try using our addition method instead of the complete sum rule to get the combined probability we see that we have a probability greater than 1 pmissingreg pmissingins 11 this is because these events are non–mutually exclusive it’s entirely possible that you have forgotten both cards therefore using this method we’re doublecounting that means we need to figure out the probability that you’re missing both cards so we can subtract it we can do this with the product rule pmissingreg missingins 024 now we can use the sum rule to determine the probability that either one of these cards is missing just as we worked out the probability of a flipping a heads or rolling a 6 pmissing pmissingreg pmissingins – pmissingreg missingins 086 with an 086 probability that one of these important pieces of paper is missing from your glove box you should make sure to be extra nice when you greet the officer wrapping up in this chapter you developed a complete logic of uncertainty by adding rules for combining probabilities with and and or let’s review the logical rules we have covered so far in chapter 2 you learned that probabilities are measured on a scale of 0 to 1 0 being falsedefinitely not going to happen and 1 being true definitely going to happen the next important logical rule involves combining two probabilities with and we do this using the product rule which simply states that to get the probability of two events occurring together p a and p b we just multiply them together p a b p a × p b the final rule involves combining probabilities with or using the sum rule the tricky part of the sum rule is that if we add non–mutually exclusive probabilities we’ll end up overcounting for the case where they both occur so we have to subtract the probability of both events occurring together the sum rule uses the product rule to solve this remember for mutually exclusive events p a b 0 p a or b p a p b – p a b these rules along with those covered in chapter 2 allow us to express a very large range of problems we’ll be using these as the foundation for our probabilistic reasoning throughout the rest of the book exercises try answering the following questions to make sure you understand the rules of logic as they apply to probability the solutions can be found at httpsnostarchcomlearnbayes 1 what is the probability of rolling a 20 three times in a row on a 20sided die 2 the weather report says there’s a 10 percent chance of rain tomorrow and you forget your umbrella half the time you go out what is the probability that you’ll be caught in the rain without an umbrella tomorrow 3 raw eggs have a 120000 probability of having salmonella if you eat two raw eggs what is the probability you ate a raw egg with salmonella 4 what is the probability of either flipping two heads in two coin tosses or rolling three 6s in three sixsided dice rolls  4 creating a binomial probability distribution in chapter 3 you learned some basic rules of probability corresponding to the common logical operators and or and not in this chapter we’re going to use these rules to build our first probability distribution a way of describing all possible events and the probability of each one happening probability distributions are often visualized to make statistics more palatable to a wider audience we’ll arrive at our probability distribution by defining a function that generalizes a particular group of probability problems meaning we’ll create a distribution to calculate the probabilities for a whole range of situations not just one particular case we generalize in this way by looking at the common elements of each problem and abstracting them out statisticians use this approach to make solving a wide range of problems much easier this can be especially useful when problems are very complex or some of the necessary details may be unknown in these cases we can use wellunderstood probability distributions as estimates for realworld behavior that we don’t fully understand probability distributions are also very useful for asking questions about ranges of possible values for example we might use a probability distribution to determine the probability that a customer makes between 30000 and 45000 a year the probability of an adult being taller than 6’ 10’’ or the probability that between 25 percent and 35 percent of people who visit a web page will sign up for an account there many probability distributions involve very complex equations and can take some time to get used to however all the equations for probability distributions are derived from the basic rules of probability covered in the previous chapters structure of a binomial distribution the distribution you’ll learn about here is the binomial distribution used to calculate the probability of a certain number of successful outcomes given a number of trials and the probability of the successful outcome the bi in the term binomial refers to the two possible outcomes that we’re concerned with an event happening and an event not happening if there are more than two outcomes the distribution is called multinomial example problems that follow a binomial distribution include the probability of  flipping two heads in three coin tosses  buying 1 million lottery tickets and winning at least once  rolling fewer than three 20s in 10 rolls of a 20sided die each of these problems shares a similar structure indeed all binomial distributions involve three parameters k the number of outcomes we care about n the total number of trials p the probability of the event happening these parameters are the inputs to our distribution so for example when we’re calculating the probability of flipping two heads in three coin tosses  k 2 the number of events we care about in this case flipping a heads  n 3 the number times the coin is flipped  p 12 the probability of flipping a heads in a coin toss we can build out a binomial distribution to generalize this kind of problem so we can easily solve any problem involving these three parameters the shorthand notation to express this distribution looks like this b k n p for the example of three coin tosses we would write b2 3 12 the b is short for binomial distribution notice that the k is separated from the other parameters by a semicolon this is because when we are talking about a distribution of values we usually care about all values of k for a fixed n and p so b k n p denotes each value in our distribution but the entire distribution is usually referred to by simply b n p let’s take a look at this more closely and see how we can build a function that allows us to generalize all of these problems into the binomial distribution understanding and abstracting out the details of our problem one of the best ways to see how creating distributions can simplify your probabilities is to start with a concrete example and try to solve that and then abstract out as many of the variables as you can we’ll continue with the example of calculating the probability of flipping two heads in three coin tosses since the number of possible outcomes is small we can quickly figure out the results we care about with just pencil and paper there are three possible outcomes with two heads in three tosses hht hth thh now it may be tempting to just solve this problem by enumerating all the other possible outcomes and dividing the number we care about by the total number of possible outcomes in this case 8 that would work fine for solving just this problem but our aim here is to solve any problem that involves desiring a set of outcomes from a number of trials with a given probability that the event occurs if we did not generalize and solved only this one instance of the problem changing these parameters would mean we have to solve the new problem again for example just saying what is the probability of getting two heads in four coin tosses means we need to come up with yet another unique solution instead we’ll use the rules of probability to reason about this problem to start generalizing we’ll break this problem down into smaller pieces we can solve right now and reduce those pieces into manageable equations as we build up the equations we’ll put them together to create a generalized function for the binomial distribution the first thing to note is that each outcome we care about will have the same probability each outcome is just a permutation or reordering of the others pheads heads tails pheads tails heads ptails heads heads since this is true we’ll simply call it pdesired outcome there are three outcomes but only one of them can possibly happen and we don’t care which and because it’s only possible for one outcome to occur we know that these are mutually exclusive denoted as pheads heads tailsheads tails headstails heads heads 0 this makes using the sum rule of probability easy now we can summarize this nicely as pheads heads tails or heads tails heads or tails heads heads pdesired outcome  pdesired outcome pdesired outcome of course adding these three is just the same as 3 × pdesired outcome we’ve got a condensed way of referencing the outcomes we care about but the trouble as far as generalizing goes is that the value 3 is specific to this problem we can fix this by simply replacing 3 with a variable called n outcomes this leaves us with a pretty nice generalization b k n p n outcomes × pdesired outcome now we have to figure out two subproblems how to count the number of outcomes we care about and how to determine the probability for a single outcome once we have these fleshed out we’ll be all set counting our outcomes with the binomial coefficient first we need to figure out how many outcomes there are for a given k the outcomes we care about and n the number of trials for small numbers we can simply count if we were looking at four heads in five coin tosses we know there are five outcomes we care about hhhht hthhh hhthh hhhth hhhht but it doesn’t take much for this to become too difficult to do by hand—for example what is the probability of rolling two 6s in three rolls of a sixsided die this is still a binomial problem because the only two possible outcomes are getting a 6 or not getting a 6 but there are far more events that count as not getting a 6 if we start enumerating we quickly see this gets tedious even for a small problem involving just three rolls of a die 6 – 6 – 1 6 – 6 – 2 6 – 6 – 3   4 – 6 – 6       5 – 6 – 6   clearly enumerating all of the possible solutions will not scale to even reasonably trivial problems the solution is combinatorics combinatorics advanced counting with the binomial coefficient we can gain some insight into this problem if we take a look at a field of mathematics called combinatorics this is simply the name for a kind of advanced counting there is a special operation in combinatorics called the binomial coefficient that represents counting the number of ways we can select k from n—that is selecting the outcomes we care about from the total number of trials the notation for the binomial coefficient looks like this we read this expression as n choose k so for our example we would represent in three tosses choose two heads as the definition of this operation is the means factorial which is the product of all the numbers up to and including the number before the symbol so 5 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 most mathematical programming languages indicate the binomial coefficient using the choosefunction for example with the mathematical language r we would compute the binomial coefficient for the case of flipping two heads in three tosses with the following call choose32 3 with this general operation for calculating the number of outcomes we care about we can update our generalized formula like so recall that pdesired outcome is the probability of any one of the combinations of getting two heads in three coin tosses in the preceding equation we use this value as a placeholder but we don’t actually know how to calculate what this value is the only missing piece of our puzzle is solving psingle outcome after that we’ll be able to easily generalize an entire class of problems    calculating the probability of the desired outcome all we have left to figure out is the pdesired outcome which is the probability of any of the possible events we care about so far we’ve been using pdesired outcome as a variable to help organize our solution to this problem but now we need to figure out exactly how to calculate this value let’s look at the probability of getting two heads in five tosses we’ll focus on a single case of an outcome that meets this condition hhttt we know the probability of flipping a heads in a single toss is 12 but to generalize the problem we’ll work with it as pheads so we won’t be stuck with a fixed value for our probability using the product rule and negation from the previous chapter we can describe this problem as pheads heads not heads not heads not heads or more verbosely as the probability of flipping heads heads not heads not heads and not heads negation tells us that we can represent not heads as 1 – pheads then we can use the product rule to solve the rest pheads heads not heads not heads not heads pheads × pheads × 1 – pheads × 1 – pheads × 1 – pheads let’s simplify the multiplication by using exponents pheads2 × 1 – pheads3 if we put this all together we see that two heads in five tosses pheads2 × 1 – pheads3 you can see that the exponents for pheads2 and 1 – pheads3 are just the number of heads and the number of not heads in that scenario these equate to k the number of outcomes we care about and n – k the number of trials minus the outcomes we care about we can put all of this together to create this much more general formula which eliminates numbers specific to this case now let’s generalize it for any probability not just heads by replacing pheads with just p this gives us a general solution for k the number of outcomes we care about n the number of trials and p the probability of the individual outcome now that we have this equation we can solve any problem related to outcomes of a coin toss for example we could calculate the probability of flipping exactly 12 heads in 24 coin tosses like so  before you learned about the binomial distribution solving this problem would have been much trickier this formula which is the basis of the binomial distribution is called a probability mass function pmf the mass part of the name comes from the fact that we can use it to calculate the amount of probability for any given k using a fixed n and p so this is the mass of our probability for example we can plug in all the possible values for k in 10 coin tosses into our pmf and visualize what the binomial distribution looks like for all possible values as shown in figure 41 figure 41 bar graph showing the probability of getting k in 10 coin flips we can also look at the same distribution for the probability of getting a 6 when rolling a sixsided die 10 times shown in figure 42  figure 42 the probability of getting a 6 when rolling a sixsided die 10 times as you can see a probability distribution is a way of generalizing an entire class of problems now that we have our distribution we have a powerful method to solve a wide range of problems but always remember that we derived this distribution from our simple rules of probability let’s put it to the test example gacha games gacha games are a genre of mobile games particularly popular in japan in which players are able to purchase virtual cards with ingame currency the catch is that all cards are given at random so when players purchase cards they can’t choose which ones they receive since not all cards are equally desirable players are encouraged to keep pulling cards from the stack until they hit the one they want in a fashion similar to a slot machine we’ll see how the binomial distribution can help us to decide to take a particular risk in an imaginary gacha game here’s the scenario you have a new mobile game bayesian battlers the current set of cards you can pull from is called a banner the banner contains some average cards and some featured cards that are more valuable as you may suspect all of the cards in bayesian battlers are famous probabilists and statisticians the top cards in this banner are as follows each with its respective probability of being pulled     thomas bayes 0721  e t jaynes 0720  harold jeffreys 0718  andrew gelman 0718  john kruschke 0714 these featured cards account for only 003591 of the total probability since probability must sum to 1 the chance of pulling the less desirable cards is the other 096409 additionally we treat the pile of cards that we pull from as effectively infinite meaning that pulling a specific card does not change the probability of getting any other card—the card you pull here does not then disappear from the pile this is different than if you were to pull a physical card from a single deck of cards without shuffling the card back in you really want the e t jaynes card to complete your elite bayesian team unfortunately you have to purchase the ingame currency bayes bucks in order to pull cards it costs one bayes buck to pull one card but there’s a special on right now allowing you to purchase 100 bayes bucks for only 10 that’s the maximum you are willing to spend on this game and only if you have at least an even chance of pulling the card you want this means you’ll buy the bayes bucks only if the probability of getting that awesome e t jaynes card is greater than or equal to 05 of course we can plug our probability of getting the e t jaynes card into our formula for the binomial distribution to see what we get our result is less than 05 so we should give up but wait—we forgot something very important in the preceding formula we calculated only the probability of getting exactly one e t jaynes card but we might pull two e t jaynes cards or even three so what we really want to know is the probability of getting one or more we could write this out as and so on for the 100 cards you can pull with your bayes bucks but this gets really tedious so instead we use the special mathematical notation σ the capital greek letter sigma the σ is the summation symbol the number at the bottom represents the value we start with and the number at the top represents the value we end with so the preceding equation is simply adding up the values for the binomial distribution for every value of k from 1 to n for a p of 000720 we’ve made writing this problem down much easier but now we actually need to compute this value rather than pulling out your calculator to solve this problem now is a great time to start using r in r we can use the pbinom function to automatically sum up all these values for k in our pmf figure 43 shows how we use pbinom to solve our specific problem    figure 43 using the pbinom function to solve our bayesian battlers problem the pbinom function takes three required arguments and an optional fourth called lowertailwhich defaults to true when the fourth argument is true the first argument sums up all of the probabilities less than or equal to our argument when lowertail is set to false it sums up the probabilities strictly greater than the first argument by setting the first argument to 0 we are looking at the probability of getting one or more e t jaynes cards we set lowertail to falsebecause that means we want values greater than the first argument by default we get values less than the first argument the next value represents n the number of trials and the third argument represents p the probability of success if we plug in our numbers here and set lowertail to false as shown in figure 43 r will calculate your probability of getting at least one e t jaynes card for your 100 bayes bucks even though the probability of getting exactly one e t jaynes card is only 0352 the probability of getting at least one e t jaynes card is high enough for you to risk it so shell out that 10 and complete your set of elite bayesians wrapping up in this chapter we saw that we can use our rules of probability combined with a trick from combinatorics to create a general rule that solves an entire class of problems any problem that involves wanting to determine the probability of k outcomes in n trials where the probability of the outcomes is p we can solve easily using the binomial distribution perhaps surprisingly there is nothing more to this rule than counting and applying our rules of probability exercises try answering the following questions to make sure you’ve grasped binomial distributions fully the solutions can be found at httpsnostarchcomlearnbayes 1 what are the parameters of the binomial distribution for the probability of rolling either a 1 or a 20 on a 20sided die if we roll the die 12 times 2 there are four aces in a deck of 52 cards if you pull a card return the card then reshuffle and pull a card again how many ways can you pull just one ace in five pulls 3 for the example in question 2 what is the probability of pulling five aces in 10 pulls remember the card is shuffled back in the deck when it is pulled 4 when you’re searching for a new job it’s always helpful to have more than one offer on the table so you can use it in negotiations if you have a 15 probability of receiving a job offer when you interview and you interview with seven companies in a month what is the probability you’ll have at least two competing offers by the end of that month 5 you get a bunch of recruiter emails and find out you have 25 interviews lined up in the next month unfortunately you know this will leave you exhausted and the probability of getting an offer will drop to 110 if you’re tired you really don’t want to go on this many interviews unless you are at least twice as likely to get at least two competing offers are you more likely to get at least two offers if you go for 25 interviews or stick to just 7  5 the beta distribution this chapter builds on the ideas behind the binomial distribution from the previous chapter to introduce another probability distribution the beta distribution you use the beta distribution to estimate the probability of an event for which you’ve already observed a number of trials and the number of successful outcomes for example you would use it to estimate the probability of flipping a heads when so far you have observed 100 tosses of a coin and 40 of those were heads while exploring the beta distribution we’ll also look at the differences between probability and statistics often in probability texts we are given the probabilities for events explicitly however in real life this is rarely the case instead we are given data which we use to come up with estimates for probabilities this is where statistics comes in it allows us to take data and make estimates about what probabilities we’re dealing with a strange scenario getting the data here’s the scenario for this chapter one day you walk into a curiosity shop the owner greets you and after you browse for a bit asks if there is anything in particular you’re looking for you respond that you’d love to see the strangest thing he has to show you he smiles and pulls something out from behind the counter you’re handed a black box about the size of a rubik’s cube that seems impossibly heavy intrigued you ask what does it do the owner points out a small slit on the top of the box and another on the bottom if you put a quarter in the top he tells you sometimes two come out the bottom excited to try this out you grab a quarter from your pocket and put it in you wait and nothing happens then the shop owner says and sometimes it just eats your quarter i’ve had this thing a while and i’ve never seen it run out of quarters or get too full to take more perplexed by this but eager to make use of your newfound probability skills you ask what’s the probability of getting two quarters the owner replies quizzically i have no idea as you can see it’s just a black box and there are no instructions all i know is how it behaves sometimes you get two quarters back and sometimes it eats your quarter distinguishing probability statistics and inference while this is a somewhat unusual everyday problem it’s actually an extremely common type of probability problem in all of the examples so far outside of the first chapter we’ve known the probability of all the possible events or at least how much we’d be willing to bet on them in real   life we are almost never sure what the exact probability of any event is instead we just have observations and data this is commonly considered the division between probability and statistics in probability we know exactly how probable all of our events are and what we are concerned with is how likely certain observations are for example we might be told that there is 12 probability of getting heads in a fair coin toss and want to know the probability of getting exactly 7 heads in 20 coin tosses in statistics we would look at this problem backward assuming you observe 7 heads in 20 coin tosses what is the probability of getting heads in a single coin toss as you can see in this example we don’t know what the probability is in a sense statistics is probability in reverse the task of figuring out probabilities given data is called inference and it is the foundation of statistics collecting data the heart of statistical inference is data so far we have only a single sample from the strange box you put in a quarter and got nothing back all we know at this point is that it’s possible to lose your money the shopkeeper said you can win but we don’t know that for sure yet we want to estimate the probability that the mysterious box will deliver two quarters and to do that we first need to see how frequently you win after a few more tries the shopkeeper informs you that he’s just as curious as you are and will gladly donate a roll of quarters—containing 10 worth of quarters or 40 quarters—provided you return any winnings to him you put a quarter in and happily two more quarters pop out now we have two pieces of data the mystical box does in fact pay out sometimes and sometimes it eats the coin given our two observations one where you lose the quarter and another where you win you might guess naively that ptwo quarters 12 since our data is so limited however there is still a range of probabilities we might consider for the true rate at which this mysterious box returns two coins to gather more data you’ll use the rest of the quarters in the roll in the end including your first quarter you get 14 wins 27 losses without doing any further analysis you might intuitively want to update your guess that ptwo quarters 12 to ptwo quarters 1441 but what about your original guess—does your new data mean it’s impossible that 12 is the real probability calculating the probability of probabilities to help solve this problem let’s look at our two possible probabilities these are just our hypotheses about the rate at which the magic box returns two quarters to simplify we’ll assign each hypothesis a variable  intuitively most people would say that h 2 is more likely because this is exactly what we observed but we need to demonstrate this mathematically to be sure we can think of this problem in terms of how well each hypothesis explains what we saw so in plain english how probable is what we observed if h 1 were true versus if h 2 were true as it turns out we can easily calculate this using the binomial distribution from chapter 4 in this case we know that n 41 and k 14 and for now we’ll assume that p h 1 or h 2 we’ll use d as a variable for our data when we plug these numbers into the binomial distribution we get the following results recall that you can do this with the formula for the binomial distribution in chapter 4 in other words if h 1 were true and the probability of getting two coins was 12 then the probability of observing 14 occasions where we get two coins out of 41 trials would be about 0016 however if h 2 were true and the real probability of getting two coins out of the box was 1441 then the probability of observing the same outcomes would be about 0130 this shows us that given the data observing 14 cases of getting two coins out of 41 trials h 2 is almost 10 times more probable than h 1 however it also shows that neither hypothesis is impossible and that there are of course many other hypotheses we could make based on our data for example we might read our data as h 3 ptwo coins 1542 if we wanted to look for a pattern we could also pick every probability from 01 to 09 incrementing by 01 calculate the probability of the observed data in each distribution and develop our hypothesis from that figure 51 illustrates what each value looks like in the latter case  figure 51 visualization of different hypotheses about the rate of getting two quarters even with all these hypotheses there’s no way we could cover every possible eventuality because we’re not working with a finite number of hypotheses so let’s try to get more information by testing more distributions if we repeat the last experiment testing each possibility at certain increments starting with 001 and ending with 099 incrementing by only 001 would give us the results in figure 52  figure 52 we see a definite pattern emerging when we look at more hypotheses we may not be able to test every possible hypothesis but it’s clear a pattern is emerging here we see something that looks like a distribution representing what we believe is the behavior of the black box this seems like valuable information we can easily see where the probability is highest our goal however is to model our beliefs in all possible hypotheses that is the full probability distribution of our beliefs there are still two problems with our approach first because there’s an infinite number of possible hypotheses incrementing by smaller and smaller amounts doesn’t accurately represent the entire range of possibilities—we’re always missing an infinite amount in practice this isn’t a huge problem because we often don’t care about the extremes like 0000001 and 00000011 but the data would be more useful if we could represent this infinite range of possibilities a bit more accurately second if you looked at the graph closely you may have noticed a larger problem here there are at least 10 dots above 01 right now and we have an infinite number of points to add this means that our probabilities don’t sum to 1 from the rules of probability we know that the probabilities of all our possible hypotheses must sum to 1 if they don’t it means that some hypotheses are not covered if they add up to more than 1 we would be violating the rule that probabilities must be between 0 and 1 even though there are infinitely many possibilities here we still need them all to sum to 1 this is where the beta distribution comes in   the beta distribution to solve both of these problems we’ll be using the beta distribution unlike the binomial distribution which breaks up nicely into discrete values the beta distribution represents a continuous range of values which allows us to represent our infinite number of possible hypotheses we define the beta distribution with a probability density function pdf which is very similar to the probability mass function we use in the binomial distribution but is defined for continuous values here is the formula for the pdf of the beta distribution now this looks like a much more terrifying formula than the one for our binomial distribution but it’s actually not that different we won’t build this formula entirely from scratch like we did with the probability mass function but let’s break down some of what’s happening here breaking down the probability density function let’s first take a look at our parameters p α lowercase greek letter alpha and β lowercase greek letter beta p represents the probability of an event this corresponds to our different hypotheses for the possible probabilities for our black box α represents how many times we observe an event we care about such as getting two quarters from the box β represents how many times the event we care about didn’t happen for our example this is the number of times that the black box ate the quarter the total number of trials is α β this is different than the binomial distribution where we have k observations we’re interested in and a finite number of n total trials the top part of the pdf function should look pretty familiar because it’s almost the same as the binomial distribution’s pmf which looks like this in the pdf rather than pk × 1 – p n– k we have p α–1 × 1 – pβ–1 where we subtract 1 from the exponent terms we also have another function in the denominator of our equation the beta function note the lowercase for which the beta distribution is named we subtract 1 from the exponent and use the beta function to normalize our values—this is the part that ensures our distribution sums to 1 the beta function is the integral from 0 to 1 of p α–1 × 1 – pβ–1 we’ll talk about integrals more in the next section but you can think of this as the sum of all the possible values of p α–1 × 1 – pβ– 1 when p is every number between 0 and 1 a discussion of how subtracting 1 from the exponents and dividing by the beta functions normalizes our values is beyond the scope of this chapter for now you just need to know that this allows our values to sum to 1 giving us a workable probability what we get in the end is a function that describes the probability of each possible hypothesis for our true belief in the probability of getting two heads from the box given that we have observed α examples of one outcome and β examples of another remember that we arrived at the beta distribution by comparing how well different binomial distributions each with its own  probability p described our data in other words the beta distribution represents how well all possible binomial distributions describe the data observed applying the probability density function to our problem when we plug in our values for our black box data and visualize the beta distribution shown in figure 53 we see that it looks like a smooth version of the plot in figure 52 this illustrates the pdf of beta1427 figure 53 visualizing the beta distribution for our data collected about the black box as you can see most of the plot’s density is less than 05 as we would expect given that our data shows that fewer than half of the quarters placed in the black box returned two quarters the plot also shows that it’s very unlikely the black box will return two quarters at least half the time which is the point at which we break even if we continually put quarters in the box we’ve figured out that we’re more likely to lose money than make money through the box without sacrificing too many quarters while we can see the distribution of our beliefs by looking at a plot we’d still like to be able to quantify exactly how strongly we believe that the probability that the true rate at which the box returns two quarters is less than 05 to do this we need just a bit of calculus and some r  quantifying continuous distributions with integration the beta distribution is fundamentally different from the binomial distribution in that with the latter we are looking at the distribution of k the number of outcomes we care about which is always something we can count for the beta distribution however we are looking at the distribution of p for which we have an infinite number of possible values this leads to an interesting problem that might be familiar if you’ve studied calculus before but it’s okay if you haven’t for our example of α14 and β27 we want to know what is the probability that the chance of getting two coins is 12 while it’s easy to ask the likelihood of an exact value with the binomial distribution thanks to its finite number of outcomes this is a really tricky question for a continuous distribution we know that the fundamental rule of probability is that the sum of all our values must be 1 but each of our individual values is infinitely small meaning the probability of any specific value is in practice 0 this may seem strange if you aren’t familiar with continuous functions from calculus so as a quick explanation this is just the logical consequence of having something made up of an infinite number of pieces imagine for example you divide a 1pound bar of chocolate pretty big into two pieces each piece would then weigh 12 a pound if you divided it into 10 pieces each piece would weigh 110 a pound as the number of pieces you divide the chocolate into grows each piece becomes so small you can’t even see it for the case where the number of pieces goes to infinity eventually those pieces disappear even though the individual pieces disappear we can still talk about ranges for example even if we divided a 1pound bar of chocolate into infinitely many pieces we can still add up the weight of the pieces in one half of the chocolate bar similarly when talking about probability in continuous distributions we can sum up ranges of values but if every specific value is 0 then isn’t the sum just 0 as well this is where calculus comes in in calculus there’s a special way of summing up infinitely small values called the integral if we want to know whether the probability that the box will return a coin is less than 05 that is the value is somewhere between 0 and 05 we can sum it up like this if you’re rusty on calculus the stretchedout s is the continuous function equivalent to ∑ for discrete functions it’s just a way to express that we want to add up all the little bits of our function see appendix b for a quick overview of the basic principles of calculus if this math is starting to look too scary don’t worry we’ll use r to calculate this for us r includes a function called dbeta that is the pdf for the beta distribution this function takes three arguments corresponding to p α and β we use this together with r’s integrate function to perform this integration automatically here we calculate the probability that the chance of getting two coins from the box is 05 given the data  integratefunctionp dbetap1427005 the result is as follows 09807613 with absolute error 59e06 the absolute error message appears because computers can’t perfectly calculate integrals so there is always some error though usually it is far too small for us to worry about this result from r tells us that there is a 098 probability that given our evidence the true probability of getting two coins out of the black box is less than 05 this means it would not be good idea to put any more quarters in the box since you very likely won’t break even reverseengineering the gacha game in reallife situations we almost never know the true probabilities for events that’s why the beta distribution is one of our most powerful tools for understanding our data in the gacha game in chapter 4 we knew the probability of each card we wanted to pull in reality the game developers are very unlikely to give players this information for many reasons such as not wanting players to calculate how unlikely they are to get the card they want now suppose we are playing a new gacha game called frequentist fighters and it also features famous statisticians this time we are pulling for the bradley efron card we don’t know the rates for the card but we really want that card—and more than one if possible we spend a ridiculous amount of money and find that from 1200 cards pulled we received only 5 bradley efron cards our friend is thinking of spending money on the game but only wants to do it if there is a better than 07 probability that the chance of pulling a bradley efron is greater than 0005 our friend has asked us to figure out whether he should spend the money and pull our data tells us that of 1200 cards pulled only 5 were bradley efron so we can visualize this as beta51195 shown in figure 54 remember that the total cards pulled is α β  figure 54 the beta distribution for getting a bradley efron card given our data from our visualization we can see that nearly all the probability density is below 001 we need to know exactly how much is above 0005 the value that our friend cares about we can solve this by integrating over the beta distribution in r as earlier integratefunctionx dbetax5119500051 029 this tells us the probability that the rate of pulling a bradley efron card is 0005 or greater given the evidence we have observed is only 029 our friend will pull for this card only if the probability is around 07 or greater so based on the evidence from our data collection our friend should not try his luck wrapping up in this chapter you learned about the beta distribution which is closely related to the binomial distribution but behaves quite differently we built up to the beta distribution by observing how well an increasing number of possible binomial distributions explained our data because our number of possible hypotheses was infinite we needed a continuous probability distribution that could describe all of them the beta distribution allows us to represent how strongly we believe in all possible probabilities for the data we observed this enables us to perform statistical inference on observed data by determining which probabilities we might assign to an event and how strongly we believe in each one a probability of probabilities the major difference between the beta distribution and the binomial distribution is that the beta distribution is a continuous probability distribution because there are an infinite number of values in the distribution we cannot sum results the same way we do in a discrete probability distribution instead we need to use calculus to sum ranges of values fortunately we can use r instead of solving tricky integrals by hand exercises try answering the following questions to make sure you understand how we can use the beta distribution to estimate probabilities the solutions can be found at httpsnostarchcomlearnbayes 1 you want to use the beta distribution to determine whether or not a coin you have is a fair coin—meaning that the coin gives you heads and tails equally you flip the coin 10 times and get 4 heads and 6 tails using the beta distribution what is the probability that the coin will land on heads more than 60 percent of the time 2 you flip the coin 10 more times and now have 9 heads and 11 tails total what is the probability that the coin is fair using our definition of fair give or take 5 percent 3 data is the best way to become more confident in your assertions you flip the coin 200 more times and end up with 109 heads and 111 tails now what is the probability that the coin is fair give or take 5 percent part ii bayesian probability and prior probabilities    6 conditional probability so far we have dealt only with independent probabilities probabilities are independent when the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of another for example flipping heads on a coin doesn’t impact whether or not a die will roll a 6 calculating probabilities that are independent is much easier than calculating probabilities that aren’t but independent probabilities often don’t reflect real life for example the probability that your alarm doesn’t go off and the probability that you’re late for work are not independent if your alarm doesn’t go off you are far more likely to be late for work than you would otherwise be in this chapter you’ll learn how to reason about conditional probabilities where probabilities are not independent but rather depend on the outcome of particular events i’ll also introduce you to one of the most important applications of conditional probability bayes’ theorem introducing conditional probability in our first example of conditional probabilities we’ll look at flu vaccines and possible complications of receiving them when you get a flu vaccine you’re typically handed a sheet of paper that informs you of the various risks associated with it one example is an increased incidence of guillainbarré syndrome gbs a very rare condition that causes the body’s immune system to attack the nervous system leading to potentially lifethreatening complications according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc the probability of contracting gbs in a given year is 2 in 100000 we can represent this probability as follows normally the flu vaccine increases your probability of getting gbs only by a trivial amount in 2010 however there was an outbreak of swine flu and the probability of getting gbs if you received the flu vaccine that year rose to 3100000 in this case the probability of contracting gbs directly depended on whether or not you got the flu vaccine and thus it is an example of a conditional probability we express conditional probabilities as p a | b or the probability of a given b mathematically we can express the chance of getting gbs as we read this expression in english as the probability of having gbs given that you got the flu vaccine is 3 in 100000  why conditional probabilities are important conditional probabilities are an essential part of statistics because they allow us to demonstrate how information changes our beliefs in the flu vaccine example if you don’t know whether or not someone got the vaccine you can say that their probability of getting gbs is 2100000 since this is the probability that any given person picked out of the population would have gbs that year if the year is 2010 and a person tells you that they got the flu shot you know that the true probability is 3100000 we can also look at this as a ratio of these two probabilities like so so if you had the flu shot in 2010 we have enough information to believe you’re 50 percent more likely to get gbs than a stranger picked at random fortunately on an individual level the probability of getting gbs is still very low but if we’re looking at populations as a whole we would expect 50 percent more people to have gbs in a population of people that had the flu vaccine than in the general population there are also other factors that can increase the probability of getting gbs for example males and older adults are more likely to have gbs using conditional probabilities we can add all of this information to better estimate the likelihood that an individual gets gbs dependence and the revised rules of probability as a second example of conditional probabilities we’ll use color blindness a vision deficiency that makes it difficult for people to discern certain colors in the general population about 425 percent of people are color blind the vast majority of cases of color blindness are genetic color blindness is caused by a defective gene in the x chromosome because males have only a single x chromosome and females have two men are about 16 times more likely to suffer adverse effects of a defective x chromosome and therefore to be color blind so while the rate of color blindness for the entire population is 425 percent it is only 05 percent in females but 8 percent in males for all of our calculations we’ll be making the simplifying assumption that the malefemale split of the population is exactly 5050 let’s represent these facts as conditional probabilities pcolor blind 00425 pcolor blind | female 0005 pcolor blind | male 008 given this information if we pick a random person from the population what’s the probability that they are male and color blind in chapter 3 we learned how we can combine probabilities with and using the product rule according to the product rule we would expect the result of our question to be pmale color blind pmale × pcolor blind 05 × 00425 002125 but a problem arises when we use the product rule with conditional probabilities the problem becomes clearer if we try to find the probability that a person is female and color blind pfemale color blind pfemale × pcolor blind 05 × 00425 002125 this can’t be right because the two probabilities are the same we know that while the probability of picking a male or a female is the same if we pick a female the probability that she is color blind should be much lower than for a male our formula should account for the fact that if we pick our person at random then the probability that they are color blind depends on whether they are male or female the product rule given in chapter 3 works only when the probabilities are independent being male or female and color blind are dependent probabilities so the true probability of finding a male who is color blind is the probability of picking a male multiplied by the probability that he is color blind mathematically we can write this as pmale color blind pmale × pcolor blind | male 05 × 008 004 we can generalize this solution to rewrite our product rule as follows p a b p a × p b | a this definition works for independent probabilities as well because for independent probabilities p b p b | a this makes intuitive sense when you think about flipping heads and rolling a 6 because psix is 16 independent of the coin toss psix | heads is also 16 we can also update our definition of the sum rule to account for this fact p a or b p a p b – p a × p b | a now we can still easily use our rules of probabilistic logic from part i and handle conditional probabilities an important thing to note about conditional probabilities and dependence is that in practice knowing how two events are related is often difficult for example we might ask about the probability of someone owning a pickup truck and having a work commute of over an hour while we can come up with plenty of reasons one might be dependent on the other—maybe people with pickup trucks tend to live in more rural areas and commute less—we might not have the data to support this assuming that two events are independent even when they likely aren’t is a very common practice in statistics but as with our example for picking a color blind male this assumption can sometimes give us very wrong results while assuming independence is often a practical necessity never forget how much of an impact dependence can have conditional probabilities in reverse and bayes’ theorem one of the most amazing things we can do with conditional probabilities is reversing the condition to calculate the probability of the event we’re conditioning on that is we can use p a | b to arrive at p b | a as an example say you’re emailing a customer service rep at a company that sells color blindness–correcting glasses the glasses are a little pricey and you mention to the rep that you’re worried they might not work the rep replies i’m also color blind and i have a pair myself—they work really well we want to figure out the probability that this rep is male however the rep provides no information except an id number so how can we figure out the probability that the rep is male we know that pcolor blind | male 008 and that pcolor blind | female 0005 but how can we determine pmale | color blind intuitively we know that it is much more likely that the customer service rep is in fact male but we need to quantify that to be sure thankfully we have all the information we need to solve this problem and we know that we are solving for the probability that someone is male given that they are color blind      pmale | color blind  the heart of bayesian statistics is data and right now we have only one piece of data other than our existing probabilities we know that the customer support rep is color blind our next step is to look at the portion of the total population that is color blind then we can figure out what portion of that subset is male to help reason about this let’s add a new variable n which represents the total population of people as stated before we first need to calculate the total subset of the population that is color blind we know pcolor blind so we can write this part of the equation like so next we need to calculate the number of people who are male and color blind this is easy to do since we know pmale and pcolor blind | male and we have our revised product rule so we can simply multiply this probability by the population pmale × pcolor blind | male × n so the probability that the customer service rep is male given that they’re color blind is our population variable n is on both the top and the bottom of the fraction so the n s cancel out we can now solve our problem since we know each piece of information given the calculation we know there is a 941 percent chance that the customer service rep is in fact male introducing bayes’ theorem there is nothing actually specific to our case of color blindness in the preceding formula so we should be able to generalize it to any given a and b probabilities if we do this we get the most foundational formula in this book bayes’ theorem to understand why bayes’ theorem is so important let’s look at a general form of this problem our beliefs describe the world we know so when we observe something its conditional probability represents the likelihood of what we’ve seen given what we believe or pobserved | belief for example suppose you believe in climate change and therefore you expect that the area where you live will have more droughts than usual over a 10year period your belief is that climate change is taking place and your observation is the number of droughts in your area let’s say there were 5 droughts in the last 10 years determining how likely it is that you’d see exactly 5 droughts in the past 10 years if there were climate change during that period may be difficult one way to do this would be to consult an expert in climate science and ask them the probability of droughts given that their model assumes climate change at this point all you’ve done is ask what is the probability of what i’ve observed given that i believe climate change is true but what you want is some way to quantify how strongly you believe climate change is really happening given what you have observed bayes’ theorem allows you to reverse pobserved | belief which you asked the climate scientist for and solve for the likelihood of your beliefs given what you’ve observed or pbelief | observed in this example bayes’ theorem allows you to transform your observation of five droughts in a decade into a statement about how strongly you believe in climate change after you have observed these droughts the only other pieces of information you need are the general probability of 5 droughts in 10 years which could be estimated with historical data and your initial certainty of your belief in climate change and while most people would have a different initial probability for climate change bayes’ theorem allows you to quantify exactly how much the data changes any belief for example if the expert says that 5 droughts in 10 years is very likely if we assume that climate change is happening most people will change their previous beliefs to favor climate change a little whether they’re skeptical of climate change or they’re al gore however suppose that the expert told you that in fact 5 droughts in 10 years was very unlikely given your assumption that climate change is happening in that case your prior belief in climate change would weaken slightly given the evidence the key takeaway here is that bayes’ theorem ultimately allows evidence to change the strength of our beliefs bayes’ theorem allows us to take our beliefs about the world combine them with data and then transform this combination into an estimate of the strength of our beliefs given the evidence we’ve observed very often our beliefs are just our initial certainty in an idea this is the p a in bayes’ theorem we often debate topics such as whether gun control will reduce violence whether increased testing increases student performance or whether public health care will reduce overall health care costs but we seldom think about how evidence should change our minds or the minds of those we’re debating bayes’ theorem allows us to observe evidence about these beliefs and quantify exactly how much this evidence changes our beliefs later in this book you’ll see how we can compare beliefs as well as cases where data can surprisingly fail to change beliefs as anyone who has argued with relatives over dinner can attest in the next chapter we’re going to spend a bit more time with bayes’ theorem we’ll derive it once more but this time with lego that way we can clearly visualize how it works we’ll also explore how we can understand bayes’ theorem in terms of more specifically modeling our existing beliefs and how data changes them wrapping up in this chapter you learned about conditional probabilities which are any probability of an event that depends on another event conditional probabilities are more complicated to work with than independent probabilities—we had to update our product rule to account for dependencies—but they lead us to bayes’ theorem which is fundamental to understanding how we can use data to update what we believe about the world exercises try answering the following questions to see how well you understand conditional probability and bayes’ theorem the solutions can be found at httpsnostarchcomlearnbayes  what piece of information would we need in order to use bayes’ theorem to determine the probability that someone in 2010 who had gbs also had the flu vaccine that year  what is the probability that a random person picked from the population is female and is not color blind  what is the probability that a male who received the flu vaccine in 2010 is either color blind or has gbs   7 bayes’ theorem with lego in the previous chapter we covered conditional probability and arrived at a very important idea in probability bayes’ theorem which states notice that here we’ve made a very small change from chapter 6 writing p b | a p a instead of p a p b | a the meaning is identical but sometimes changing the terms around can help clarify different approaches to problems with bayes’ theorem we can reverse conditional probabilities—so when we know the probability p b | a we can work out p a | b bayes’ theorem is foundational to statistics because it allows us to go from having the probability of an observation given a belief to determining the strength of that belief given the observation for example if we know the probability of sneezing given that you have a cold we can work backward to determine the probability that you have a cold given that you sneezed in this way we use evidence to update our beliefs about the world in this chapter we’ll use lego to visualize bayes’ theorem and help solidify the mathematics in your mind to do this let’s pull out some lego bricks and put some concrete questions to our equation figure 71 shows a 6 × 10 area of lego bricks that’s a 60stud area studs are the cylindrical bumps on lego bricks that connect them to each other    figure 71 a 6 × 10stud lego area to help us visualize the space of possible events we can imagine this as the space of 60 possible mutually exclusive events for example the blue studs could represent 40 students who passed an exam and the red studs 20 students who failed the exam in a class of 60 in the 60stud area there are 40 blue studs so if we put our finger on a random spot the probably of touching a blue brick is defined like this we would represent the probability of touching a red brick as follows the probability of touching either a blue or a red brick as you would expect is 1   pblue pred 1 this means that red and blue bricks alone can describe our entire set of possible events now let’s put a yellow brick on top of these two bricks to represent some other possibility—for example the students that pulled an allnighter studying and didn’t sleep—so it looks like figure 72 figure 72 placing a 2 × 3 lego brick on top of the 6 × 10stud lego area now if we pick a stud at random the probability of touching the yellow brick is but if we add pyellow to pred pblue we’d get a result greater than 1 and that’s impossible the issue of course is that our yellow studs all sit on top of the space of red and blue studs so the probability of getting a yellow brick is conditional on whether we’re on a blue or red space as we  know from the previous chapter we can express this conditional probability as pyellow | red or the probability of yellow given red given our example from earlier this would be the probability that a student pulled an allnighter given that they had failed an exam working out conditional probabilities visually let’s go back to our lego bricks and work out pyellow | red figure 73 gives us a bit of visual insight into the problem figure 73 visualizing p yellow | red let’s walk through the process for determining pyellow | red by working with our physical representation 1 split the red section off from the blue       2 get the area of the entire red space it’s a 2 × 10stud area so that’s 20 studs 3 get the area of the yellow block on the red space which is 4 studs 4 divide the area of the yellow block by the area of the red block this gives us pyellow | red 420 15 great—we have arrived at the conditional probability of yellow given red so far so good so what if we now reverse that conditional probability and ask what is pred | yellow in plain english if we know we are on a yellow space what is the probability that it’s red underneath or in our test example what is the probability that a student failed the exam given that they pulled an allnighter looking at figure 73 you may have intuitively figured out pred | yellowby reasoning there are 6 yellow studs 4 of which are over red so the probability of choosing a yellow that’s over a red block is 46 if you did follow this line of thinking then congratulations you just independently discovered bayes’ theorem but let’s quantify that with math to make sure it’s right working through the math getting from our intuition to bayes’ theorem will require a bit of work let’s begin formalizing our intuition by coming up with a way to calculate that there are 6 yellow studs our minds arrive at this conclusion through spatial reasoning but we need to use a mathematical approach to solve this we just take the probability of being on a yellow stud multiplied by the total number of studs the next part of our intuitive reasoning is that 4 of the yellow studs are over red and this requires a bit more work to prove mathematically first we have to establish how many red studs there are luckily this is the same process as calculating yellow studs we’ve also already figured out the ratio of red studs covered by yellow as pyellow | red to make this a count—rather than a probability—we multiply it by the number of red studs that we just calculated finally we get the ratio of the red studs covered by yellow to the total number of yellow this lines up with our intuitive analysis however it doesn’t quite look like a bayes’ theorem equation which should have the following structure to get there we’ll have to go back and expand the terms in this equation like so   we know that we calculate this as follows finally we just need to cancel out totalstuds from the equation which gives us from intuition we have arrived back at bayes’ theorem wrapping up conceptually bayes’ theorem follows from intuition but that doesn’t mean that the formalization of bayes’ theorem is obvious the benefit of our mathematical work is that it extracts reason out of intuition we’ve confirmed that our original intuitive beliefs are consistent and now we have a powerful new tool to deal with problems in probability that are more complicated than lego bricks in the next chapter we’ll take a look at how to use bayes’ theorem to reason about and update our beliefs using data exercises try answering the following questions to see if you have a solid understanding of how we can use bayes’ theorem to reason about conditional probabilities the solutions can be found at httpsnostarchcomlearnbayes 1 kansas city despite its name sits on the border of two us states missouri and kansas the kansas city metropolitan area consists of 15 counties 9 in missouri and 6 in kansas the entire state of kansas has 105 counties and missouri has 114 use bayes’ theorem to calculate the probability that a relative who just moved to a county in the kansas city metropolitan area also lives in a county in kansas make sure to show pkansas assuming your relative either lives in kansas or missouri pkansas city metropolitan area and pkansas city metropolitan area | kansas 2 a deck of cards has 52 cards with suits that are either red or black there are four aces in a deck of cards two red and two black you remove a red ace from the deck and shuffle the cards your friend pulls a black card what is the probability that it is an ace chapter seventeen to my relief – and no small astonishment – i realised that i was down alive and mostly unhurt the dropship was perfectly still through my visor and the curve of the transparent segment of the hull beyond it i made out a low rustcoloured ridge which seemed to be a few hundred metres away nearer me was an area of sloping ground dotted with small sharp boulders the sky was a pale buff deceptively bright it did not take many atoms to scatter the sun’s radiation in a way that suggested the full comforting blanket of a breathable atmosphere i was on my side nearly horizontal none of the other dropships were to be seen although a few faint smoke trails still lingered in the air i ran a systems review if i had a broken limb or irreparable damage to my suit my mission was finished none of us was indispensable and the others could find workarounds for my absence but the suit was intact a good a thing too as i would be totally dependent on it for my entire spell on mars the dropship was finished its outer skin burned to a crisp but that was to be expected it had never been meant to do more than get me onto the surface its only remaining task was to conceal itself as for my body the toll of damage was about as serious as it could be without actually preventing me from continuing i had neither broken nor dislocated any limbs i did have a bruised or fractured rib or two and there was ligament and muscle damage around my hips and knees i had suffered mild concussion during the landing and had a small retinal bleed in one eye i seemed to have bitten my tongue and chipped a tooth i could cope with all of that – and would have to immediately before moving though i scrolled through the medical diagnostic options and authorised my suit to do whatever was required to make me functional microsyringes pricked my skin around the damaged joints and pumped a cocktail of steroids antiinflammatories and localised painkillers into the affected regions i soon felt a warm numbness around my hips and knees as awkward and uncoordinated as it made me feel it allowed me to begin the work ahead groaning against the pain of my ribs – there was nothing the suit could do for me there – i cracked open the dropship’s hull and wriggled out of its closefitting compartment somewhat unsteadily i stood up and moved around the wreckage lying there on the ground still smoking the dropship looked far too small to have contained me let alone to have been my home for the three months it had taken to reach mars heatproof compartments had been built into its skin for equipment too bulky to be stowed inside along with my suit i kicked at these scorched hatches until they sprang open then collected the items stored inside i fixed them onto the many attachment points on my suit survival rations medical supplies small arms ammunition – and one heavy machine gun which i stowed on a specially engineered rig across my lower back beneath my rear lifesupport pack i checked the dropship over one final time making sure i had left nothing then sent the verbal command that instructed it to selfbury parts of its hull moved counter to each other in a complex spiralling pattern cutting surfaces digging into the ground and slowly gaining traction it looked like a dark squirming maggot i stood back and watched for the five minutes it took the dropship to fully submerge itself it would keep going down until it hit bedrock and then begin an even slower process of autocatalytic breakdown denying the conjoiners any useful components or materials if they were ever lucky enough to find the burial spot i scuffed over the disturbed ground with my heel the surface disturbance was actually quite minor winds were due in a few days and would soon conceal evidence of the burial in the meantime it would simply look like the impact point of a piece of debris from the asteroid exactly as planned footprints were more of a problem each of us had to cross hundreds of kilometres to the rendezvous point and still more to the capsule fortunately the mission planners had considered this detail my suit had thickened bulges around its ankles and sleeves these were a missionspecific augmentation containing telescopic stilts i deployed the ankle stilts a step at a time teetering on my rising height until they were at their maximum extension after a few seconds of unsteadiness my balance came back we had trained well enough that using the legs was mostly second nature the sleevemounted stilts were reserved for scrambling over difficult terrain and i would not need them immediately the stilts had been carefully engineered to leave the minimum possible ground disturbance while just supporting my weight they were also made of a strong thermal insulator so that we minimised our heat transfer to the terrain – critical as we would need to keep moving in the hours of darkness the final adaptation to the suit was a huge selfdeploying camouflage parasol it popped out of a compartment in the top of my backpack pushed up on a stalk above my head then flung out overlapping segments to an adjustable radius of up to three metres the parasol had a domed profile so that its edges drooped to within about a metre of the surface it obstructed my sightline but the parasol was sewn with arrays of sensors which fed a visual overlay to my visor in an emergency i could squat low blending with the ground under total concealment the parasol’s upper surface was constantly adjusting itself to achieve a seamless match of colour texture and temperature with the ground underneath it it was a lot of trouble to go to given that the conjoiners had little opportunity for overhead surveillance but its main purpose was to deceive the neutral demarchists into believing that the coalition was still fully compliant with its treaties i moved off making fourmetre strides with each swing of my stilts there was no transition no easy buildup i was immediately into my rhythm moving at the unforgiving pace we had trained for through the numbing fog of the drugs i still felt the protestation of my joints and muscles if it became unbearable the suit could increase its anaesthetic dosage but the one thing i could not do – would not permit myself to do – was to slow or to stop a pulse on my faceplate showed the direction i needed to go and the estimated distance to the rendezvous point six hundred kilometres under training conditions i had averaged two hundred kilometres a day if the terrain was not too treacherous three days continual movement without rest undaunted emptying my mind of all thoughts except the need to make the next stride i strode on nevil would not thank any of us for delaying his escape least of all me the ship ushered me to the control room without delay before i took my seat the false windows were already giving me a good idea of our position an ochre haze arced away from the ship to port and starboard darkening to black overhead i could see a few stars and maybe a few dull moving glints from whatever was left of the rust belt but we were not yet in space there had been ample time though given the time i had been with glass so scythe must have been delaying its exit for a reason the only one i could think of was that it was already considered too dangerous for us to lose the relative cover of the atmosphere ‘ship’ i said buckling myself in ‘glass says that you’ll accept my commands up to a point put me in contact with lady arek as securely as you can manage’ lady arek’s voice emerged from the console a moment later ‘hourglass’ ‘no it’s me glass is out of action for the time being how much do you know’ ‘almost nothing we have our own situation out here and it is not improving glass is hurt what about you and pinky’ ‘we’re both all right – both safe on the ship and clear of chasm city the ninecats turned on glass but she says the ship can help her recover her from her injuries is it safe to remain in communication’ ‘you will know the moment it isn’t’ i studied the location fix by which the laser was maintaining its lock on lady arek’s ship her position was a few hundred kilometres higher than my own well out of the atmosphere and moving so as to blend in with the flow of debris around the planet but she was not on any sort of trajectory that would bring her back to the stronghold ‘we have a complication lady arek i don’t know how much glass or the ship communicated to you but we’re carrying hyperpig evacuees from the swinehouse’ ‘how many’ ‘i haven’t done a head count around a hundred i’d guess maybe a few more’ ‘what are your intentions with them’ ‘i don’t have any glass rescued them without telling us can the stronghold make room for them until we come up with something better’ i felt as if i was talking into a void ‘lady arek’ her voice sounded broken drained of the last drop of hope ‘it’s finished the wolves have identified it as a source of organised human activity and now they’re massing the defences have been activated but the best they can manage is a delaying action i’ve aborted my return the only safe action now is to dock with scythe and exchange the gideon stones’ ‘what about the people still there’ ‘i am afraid there is no way out for them they know this clavain they are as resigned to it as i am’ ‘we can’t just give in’ i protested ‘we’re not giving in’ there was a fierce rebuttal in her words ‘we have the stones all nine i brought the single stone with us in case a comparison was needed now all we need is to arrange a rendezvous for which the destruction of the stronghold will provide a useful distraction’ lady arek was silent for a moment ‘i imagine you think that i take this all a little coldly you underestimate me i’ve thought this through a thousand times considered every possible response every possible getout clause nothing works the only good outcome we can achieve today is not dying are you intending to die warren clavain’ ‘of course not’ ‘then here are my instructions follow them’ i told the ship to instigate my orders in five minutes which gave me time to get back down to pinky and the refugees ‘did you see glass’ ‘yes – and i think she’ll be all right once she’s spent some time in the infirmary for now we’re on our own though i’ve spoken to lady arek our best course of action lies in an immediate rendezvous with her ship’ ‘why don’t we wait until we’re safe inside the stronghold’ ‘it’s tactically inadvisable’ ‘why’ i nodded out over the heads of the refugees recognising the most prominent of them and making mental notes of some of the others and speaking to all of them ‘in a few minutes we’re going to accelerate hard if i know the ship then it will orientate its interior surfaces to minimise the risk of injury but that doesn’t mean it won’t be hard spread yourself out as best you can and get as low to the floor as possible if you have clothing or other items that can serve as cushioning use it do what you can for the injured and infirm the acceleration won’t last long after which we’ll be weightless that carries its own hazards of course do not allow yourselves to drift too far from any surface in case the ship needs to make a sudden course change’ i raised my hands slowly as if in surrender ‘i wish this wasn’t the welcome but for the moment it’s all we can offer in about two hours we make rendezvous with another ship if that goes well we can begin to talk about the future but for now concentrate on getting through these next two hours’ ‘something’s not going to plan’ said the hyperpig called barras ‘we’re in the woods’ i said ‘but there’s a way out provided we make the right decisions’ i made a lowering gesture with my hands encouraging them to get down on the floor in ones and twos they began to comply until barras spoke up and made them scramble for a patch of floor quickly the pigs rummaged around among their rags plumping up anything that would offer a degree of cushioning ‘you too pinky’ i said lowering myself as well ‘we’ll ride this out down here the ship knows what it needs to do’ he settled next to me both of us picking a spot of floor space on the edge of the refugees but not separated from them in a low gruff tone he said ‘you didn’t answer my question’ i looked down at my folded legs ‘there’s a reason for that’ ‘how bad is it’ ‘bad enough that there are things lady arek would rather you heard from her lips’ ‘then whatever promise you made to her you’ve already halfbroken it’ ‘actually i think i may have broken all of it’ ‘then you might as well tell me whatever it is she doesn’t think i need to know right now’ i felt as if i were sitting next to a bomb and had just begun to play with a naked flame i wondered about the rage that might be in him and the imperfect control he had over that rage perhaps lady arek had only ever been trying to spare me as the bringer of bad news perhaps she knew what he was capable of doing to me ‘we can’t go back’ ‘can’t or shouldn’t’ ‘the wolves are already there’ his next question was all the more unsettling for its calm reasonableness it only made me wonder what was being bottled up under steadily rising pressure ‘snowdrop and the others are gone’ ‘lady arek says they’re putting up a defence’ ‘they know it won’t make a difference once a wolf agglomeration locks on in force it’s only a matter of time’ he settled on his haunches squattrunked and bowlegged as he was he seemed more comfortable on the floor than i did ‘they know it’s futile they could end it in a second by overloading the stronghold’s reactors’ ‘but they won’t’ i answered ‘because they want to give us a chance while they can provide a distraction the wolves won’t necessarily pick up on our ships’ ‘is lady arek in contact with snowdrop or inferring this from longrange observations’ ‘she didn’t say’ ‘i’d like to know’ i had not been keeping a mental count but the five minutes must have expired because the acceleration began to rise it was a gradual shift to begin with and i was relieved to find that my sense of vertical did not begin to wander the ship was pressing us against the floor but at least we were not being dashed against the walls buried in a suffocating boneshattering pile groans and cries came from the refugees and i imagined some of them were having old or recent injuries put under unpleasant stress but if they could get through these next two minutes i might at least be able to keep them alive for another two hours ‘there’s something else we need to discuss’ i said quietly ‘now that we’ve got that small business of the death of my partner and most of my community out the way you mean’ ‘i don’t mean that once we’re weightless we’ll go forward and see if we can reestablish contact with lady arek but there’s a snag with this plan you and i will be all right there are acceleration couches in the control room glass will be all right as well she’s in some kind of suspension bottle but everyone else will need to be prepared for ten gees of deceleration’ pinky lifted his head against the strain of two additional gravities and glanced out at the refugees ‘a snag you call it’ ‘there was no other way that made this feasible the one saving grace is that it won’t be for long’ he regarded me for a long moment then nodded ‘you looked at the other options’ ‘yes and they were all significantly worse’ ‘and when we get the gideon stones what then’ ‘glass said something about ararat not the first time it’s come up either’ ‘have you been to ararat stink’ ‘no is there a reason i should have’ he chose his answer carefully ‘it’s an interesting place’ ‘you’d know’ ‘we were all there me lady arek  the old man lived there awhile bad things happened on ararat and then we left part of me would be very happy never to have to go back’ ‘part of you’ ‘actually make that all of me’ by the time scythe shrugged itself clear of yellowstone’s atmosphere it was already moving ballistically with just enough excess speed to intersect lady arek’s orbit the pigs took to weightlessness quite well to begin with – even after all they had been through it was a pleasant novelty to experience for the first time – but i knew very well that a host of unpleasant sideeffects were likely to come their way shortly and few if any of them would be prepared the air circulators were going to be dealing with a lot more than just gaseous waste products so i hoped glass had insisted on ample redundancy pinky took to the weightlessness with no difficulty between us we made quick progress back up to the control room with me mentally counting down the minutes until we would need a system in place to safeguard the refugees pinky and i agreed that we would coordinate our tasks in tandem he would signal lady arek getting clarification on the situation at the stronghold and i would try to persuade the ship that it needed to provide protection for the new passengers if all else failed i was counting on glass still being this side of consciousness so that she could instruct the ship directly but i was starting to worry that she had already withdrawn into herself ‘you can tell lady arek we’re on our way’ i said to pinky once i had instructed the ship to open a channel for him ‘our estimated time of arrival will be  one hundred and nine minutes from now in all likelihood she won’t see any trace of us until we’re right on top of her and slowing down hard so warn her to stand down any antiship weapons she might have armed’ ‘worried she’ll hurt us’ ‘more worried what scythe might do in return’ pinky and lady arek communicated and although my attention was on the task of making arrangements for the refugees i still caught most of the exchange for two old allies – two old friends as far as i could tell – it was not far off a screaming argument lady arek was furious with me for telling pinky what was happening to the stronghold pinky was furious with lady arek for presuming to think that he would not be levelheaded enough to process this news like a rational being lady arek in turn was furious at him for having the temerity to presume upon the wisdom of her reticence and to dare to suggest that it was rooted in anything other than kind concern and a deepseated understanding of the extremes he might go to in the service of a lost cause ‘you are the bravest of all of us’ she was shouting ‘the one who only today offered up his life for the greater cause of our struggle but then there was a chance a shred of a hope just enough reason to believe with the stronghold we are far past that point nothing can be done nothing at all and i will not risk the life of my dearest friend twice in one day’ ‘how dare you call me brave and then keep this from me while telling him—’ ‘he needed to know that the stronghold was not a viable destination’ she replied her voice breaking on her fury and so it went while i kept on trying to find some way of alerting the ship that it needed to take care of its own perhaps my message had got through perhaps it had not there was no way to tell gradually the shouting and screaming gave way to something loosely resembling reasoned dialogue and after some deliberation lady arek was persuaded to share the intelligence she was gathering from the stronghold we only got a small part of it since the data had to be compressed to the point where it could share the voiceonly laserlink without degrading the signal it was enough from what we were shown it was clear that we had no hope of rescuing snowdrop and the others the stronghold was still intact but it was wreathed in a thickening cloud of black machines partially or totally obscuring the view of it from the monitoring eyes lady arek had sprinkled around the rust belt the wolves were concentrating in shelllike waves clotting around the little asteroid and then falling inward where the view was clearest we could see that the stronghold was fighting back with bursts of energy stabbing out from dozens of previously concealed weapons emplacements sycamore trees my children like to play an ageold game with me called why i’ll tell them for instance that i need them to finish breakfast and they’ll say why and i’ll say so that you receive adequate nutrition and hydration and they’ll say why and i’ll say because as your parent i feel obligated to protect your health and they’ll say why and i’ll say partly because i love you and partly because of evolutionary imperatives baked into my biology and they’ll say why and i’ll say because the species wants to go on and they’ll say why and i’ll pause for a long time before saying i don’t know i guess i believe in spite of it all that the human enterprise has value and then there will be a silence a blessed and beautiful silence will spread across the breakfast table i might even see a kid pick up a fork and then just as the silence seems ready to take off its coat and stay awhile one of my kids will say why  when i was a teenager i used the why game as a way of establishing that if you dig deep enough there is no why i reveled in nihilism more than that i liked being certain about it certain that everyone who believed life had inherent meaning was an idiot certain that meaning is just a lie we tell ourselves to survive the pain of meaninglessness  a while back my brain started playing a game similar to the why game this one is called what’s even the point there’s an edna st vincent millay poem i’ve quoted in two of my novels and will now quote again because i’ve never come across anything that describes my depressive blizzards so perfectly that chill is in the air the poem begins which the wise know well and have even learned to bear this joy i know will soon be under snow i’m in an airport in late 2018 when suddenly i feel that chill in the air what’s even the point i’m about to fly to milwaukee on a tuesday afternoon about to herd with other moderately intelligent apes into a tube that will spew a truly astonishing amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in order to transport us from one population center to a different one nothing that anyone has to do in milwaukee really matters because nothing really matters when my mind starts playing what’s even the point i can’t find a point to making art which is just using the finite resources of our planet to decorate i can’t find a point to planting gardens which is just inefficiently creating food that will sustain our useless vessels for a little while longer and i can’t find a point to falling in love which is just a desperate attempt to stave off the loneliness that you can never truly solve for because you are always alone way down in the dark which is you as robert penn warren put it except it’s not a darkness it’s much worse than that when my brain plays what’s even the point what actually descends upon me is a blizzard of blinding frozen white light being in the dark doesn’t hurt but this does like staring at the sun that millay poem refers to the eye’s bright trouble it seems to me that the bright trouble is the light you see the first time you open your eyes after birth the light that makes you cry your first tears the light that is your first fear what’s even the point all this trial and travail for what will become nothing and soon sitting in the airport i’m disgusted by my excesses my failures my pathetic attempts to forge some meaning or hope from the materials of this meaningless world i’ve been tricking myself thinking there was some reason for all of it thinking that consciousness was a miracle when it’s really a burden thinking that to be alive was wondrous when it’s really a terror the plain fact my brain tells me when it plays this game is that the universe doesn’t care if i’m here night falls fast millay wrote today is in the past  the thing about this game is that once my brain starts playing it i can’t find a way to stop any earnest defense i try to mount is destroyed instantaneously by the searing white light and i feel like the only way to survive life is to cultivate an ironic detachment from it if i can’t be happy i at least want to be cool when my brain is playing what’s even the point hope feels so flimsy and naïve—especially in the face of the endless outrages and horrors of human life what kind of mouthbreathing jackass looks at the state of human experience and responds with anything other than absolute despair i stop believing in the future there’s a character in jacqueline woodson’s novel if you come softly who says that he looks into the future and sees only this big blank space where i should be when i think of the future i start to only see the big blank space the whyless bright terror as for the present it hurts everything hurts the pain ripples beneath my skin boneshocking what’s the point of all this pain and yearning why  despair isn’t very productive that’s the problem with it like a replicating virus all despair can make is more of itself if playing what’s even the point made me a more committed advocate for justice or environmental protection i’d be all for it but the white light of despair instead renders me inert and apathetic i struggle to do anything it’s hard to sleep but it’s also hard not to i don’t want to give in to despair i don’t want to take refuge in the detached ridicule of emotion i don’t want to be cool if cool means being cold to or distant from the reality of experience depression is exhausting it gets old so fast listening to the elaborate prose of your brain tell you that you’re an idiot for even trying when the game is being played i feel certain it will never end but that is a lie like most certainties now always feels infinite and never is i was wrong about life’s meaninglessness when i was a teenager and i’m wrong about it now the truth is far more complicated than mere hopelessness  believe my friend amy krouse rosenthal once told me to look at the word and be awed by it see how it contains both be and live we were eating lunch together and after telling me about how much she liked the word believe the conversation drifted off toward family or work and then out of nowhere she said believe be live what a word etymology dictionaries tell me that believe comes from protogermanic roots meaning to hold dear or to care i like that almost as much as amy’s etymology i must choose to believe to care to hold dear i keep going i go to therapy i try a different medication i meditate even though i despise meditation i exercise i wait i work to believe to hold dear to go on twentytwo sure i’ll be your accessory to larceny here’s another thing—no the thing in fact italics emphasis and all—about black people no it’s not the slavery or the sickle cell or even the fact that we get to use the clear crisp version of the nword with a hard er on the tail of it no it’s something much simpler i’d use the word primal if it weren’t for the unfortunate connotation it’s that we have something in common something others don’t something that deep down makes us like each other—even if only a little—in spaces that at a glance don’t belong to us it’s similar to spotting someone in a crowded airport whose tshirt claims a common alma mater somewhere out east it’s the same kinship that leaves my cousin watson up on his lawn chair at barbecues telling jokes like what do you get when you put a blood a crip a businessman and two guns in an elevator that’s the very joke that echoes in your head as you hear hey man got the time in broad daylight cutting through a parking garage and then an alley between nueces street and rio grande street um what you ask removing your headphones the man seems annoyed he has to repeat himself you’ve got the time brother it’s an exclamation point not a question mark but you look down at your phone even though your heart’s beating faster and you don’t know why yet the kinship that two seconds later makes the sudden knifepoint at your throat and the railing against your neck something less than completely overwhelming he holds it sloppily leaving you more than enough room to breathe and even to potentially shout you’ve never held a knife to anyone’s neck—never thought to—but you’ve watched enough of the wire to think it ought to be placed right under the adam’s apple and flipped around to give you the edge of the blade instead it’s that exact sort of sloppiness that keeps disposable henchmen and thugs on the big screen you wait for the fear to kick in but for some reason it doesn’t under this bright deadly texan sun you’re both the exact shade so no brother bro homey homedog nigga nigger i will not give you my iphone you must be out your goddamn mind boy yes as a matter of fact i do think you’s playin’ and if the blade hadn’t just shifted to a more dangerous and competent position just now i would even be inclined to tell you as much after a few seconds this stupidity starts to feel a lot like courage you start to think of a clever facebook status update to cover these events it’s the old iphone you’re gonna have to mug someone new in a few days you hear yourself scoff out of nowhere because suddenly and without much precedent the coward has balls besides aren’t you a writer the fellowship stipend says so isn’t there a certain romance to dying stupidly and before your time isn’t that the story you’ve been pacing around for the image of mom choking up during the eulogy is the only thing that ultimately makes you bundle up your headphones and hand the whole thing over she hates public speaking almost as much as you love it but would feel compelled to speak on that day to put her in that position seems cruel but you can’t help it you lower your voice and force every neuron in your brain to lose your foreign and harmless accent if only for the space of the next few words twentynine million people in this state and you’re gonna go after a brother huh he holds the phone for a few seconds as if considering a rebuttal and then hands it back to you before taking a step back to release you in turn you resist the urge to frantically rub your throat he looks at you nods and tells you to take it easy before slinking back into the shadows yeah you too bro take it easy or no actually you suddenly feel like turning back and screaming don’t take it easy in fact go die in a fire of klansman anger you freaking statistic but you’ve already been stupid enough for one day—no one asked for the time in new york city no one stops to answer you think that back there you would have been smarter than this don’t make eye contact with the two young asian women—iphones and clutch purses in hand—who look like they might be going up the alley just as you’re coming out it illogical as it is don’t you owe him something didn’t he just do you a solid smile at them apologetically maybe they should know that some of us smile and will hopefully remember it afterward get angrier with yourself with every step there was no story here today nothing to update nothing to see just two black guys the exact same shade perpetuating stereotypes the lawn chair breaks before watson’s done aunt atalante shakes her head dead businessman watson says and grins dusting himself off and holding his side epilogue  after i finished reporting for this book on president trump i felt weariness the country was in real turmoil the virus was out of control the economy was in crisis with more than 40 million out of work a powerful reckoning on racism and inequality was upon us there seemed to be no end in sight and certainly no clear path to get there i thought back to the conversation with trump on february 7 when he mentioned the dynamite behind every door the unexpected explosion that could change everything he was apparently thinking about some external event that would affect the trump presidency but now i’ve come to the conclusion that the dynamite behind the door was in plain sight it was trump himself the oversized personality the failure to organize the lack of discipline the lack of trust in others he had picked in experts the undermining or the attempted undermining of so many american institutions the failure to be a calming healing voice the unwillingness to acknowledge error the failure to do his homework to extend the olive branch to listen carefully to others to craft a plan trump returned my call three days later june 22 at 815 pm i just got to the white house and i’m watching a—an event go down where they’re trying to rip down a statue in washington dc and we’re stopping them with great force i think protesters were trying to tear down the andrew jackson statue in lafayette square as we spoke police began to push protesters away from the still standing statue with tear gas and batons i’ll let you know trump said but it’s terrible what’s going on terrible what do you think of all that i asked i think it’s a disgrace i think it’s disgraceful and it’s—you know it’s been going on for a long time indirectly but it’s gotten more direct and i’ve stopped them on the federal basis i’ve stopped them strongly but some of these states are in some cases foolish in some cases weak he wanted to talk about his rally in tulsa his first in 60 days which had been held over the weekend less than half of the arena was filled and trump had to stare into rows of empty blue seats the focus of most media coverage it just came out that the headline quote ‘trump rally gives fox news the largest saturday night audience in its history’  he read to me i’d say that’s not bad even by your standard right for two weeks he said these people did nothing but talk about if you go there it’s going to be a death chamber you’ll die essentially they basically said horrible horrible things about don’t go there don’t go don’t go the networks you know the fake news then we had protesters there who were quite violent tulsa’s top public health official had said he wished the event could be postponed calling it a huge risk factor all the accounts i found said there was very little violence the first empty seats i’ve ever had he said how long did you work on your speech i asked you’re using the teleprompter on that you have to i have done a tremendous amount for the black community trump said and honestly i’m not feeling any love as soon as the china virus came in—as soon as the plague china virus came in—as soon as it came in—those poll numbers all of a sudden started inching back down 8 or 9 or 10 percent and i don’t understand that i don’t because nobody blames me for the virus of course many people and perhaps history might blame him for mishandling the crisis it’s a matter of the heart and the spirit i said are you saying to people who are black lives matter who are minorities in this country you are welcome here the door is very wide open he said i want to include all people i want to include all americans the door is absolutely open and he went back to his talking points about all he had done for black americans so what’s your goal here my goal is to do a great job as president he said he talked about numbers jobs growth he seemed not to understand that i was trying to ask about outreach and healing you’ll do a third book in the next year he said next year’s going to be a fantastic year watch as you know i said the virus is on fire absolutely on fire it’s only on fire because of our testing because we’re testing 40 million people he said jared kushner trump’s soninlaw maybe had it more right than he knew when he said understanding trump meant understanding alice in wonderland trump talked a lot almost incessantly so much that he weakened the microphone of the presidency and the bully pulpit and too many people no longer trusted what he said half or more of the country seemed to be in a perpetual rage about him and he seemed to enjoy it i think of robert redfield knowing that the virus fight would not be merely six months or a year it would be two to three years of trump repeatedly saying the virus would disappear or blow away and of the enormous wearing down of public health officials to not stray too far from the president’s message i close out this book with a belief that almost anything can happen in the trump presidency—anything lots could get better or worse or much worse it is unlikely lots could get much better for the moment in the middle of the summer the virus the economy and the internal political divisions define trump the intensity of those divisions is at its height the concentration of power in the presidency has been growing for decades and the power of the president might be at an alltime high under trump trump uses it especially in dominating the media trump has talked very tough often in a way that unsettles even his supporters but he has not imposed martial law or suspended the constitution despite predictions of his opponents he and his attorney general william barr have several times challenged the traditional rule of law unnecessarily in my view using the justice system to reward friends and pay back enemies is petty and nixonian constitutional government might seem wobbly at times and that could change overnight still democracy has held but leadership has failed what did trump want to accomplish what were his goals too often he seemed not to know himself decision by tweet often without warning to those charged with executing his policies was one of the biggest sticks of dynamite behind the door his relationship and letters with north korean leader kim jong un outlined in detail here were not by the foreign policy establishment playbook but as trump says repeatedly we had no war that was an achievement diplomacy should always be worth a try it may have been worth it where it goes next is one of the imponderables of the trump era is trump’s and kim’s mutual pledge of fealty—the fantasy film—sustainable as kim is more threatening we’ll see as trump says all the time the shadowy presence of trump’s soninlaw jared kushner is another imponderable highly competent but often shockingly misguided in his assessments kushner’s role is jarring was there no one else to act as chief of staff trump’s friends are mostly others with money or social standing or those who liked to talk on the phone at night was there no real friend who shared trump’s interest in governing who could help and be called to service senator lindsey graham trump’s first friend in the senate has often been portrayed as embarrassingly and shamelessly subservient to the president but actually at times provided wise counsel urging trump to take a strategic view on january 28 2020 when trump’s national security adviser and his deputy warned trump that the virus would be—not might be but would be—the biggest national security threat to his presidency the leadership clock had to be reset it was a detailed forecast supported by evidence and experience that unfortunately turned out to be correct presidents are the executive branch there was a duty to warn to listen to plan and to take care for a long time trump hedged as did others and said the virus is worrisome but not yet not now there were good reasons to ride both horses but there should have been more consistent and courageous outspokenness leading is almost always risky the virus the plague as trump calls it put the united states and the world in economic turmoil that may not be just a recession but a depression it is a genuine financial crisis putting tens of millions out of work trump’s solution is to try to recreate what he believes is the economic miracle he created in the previrus time democrats republicans and trump did agree to spending at least 22 trillion on recovery which will create its own future problems with growing deficits the human cost has been almost unimaginable with more than 130000 americans killed by the virus by july and no real end in sight the deepseated hatreds of american politics flourished in the trump years he stoked them and did not make concerted efforts to bring the country together nor did the democrats trump felt deeply wronged by the democrats who felt deeply wronged by trump the walls between them only grew higher and thicker my 17 interviews with trump presented a challenge he denounced fear my first book on him as untrue a scam and a joke calling me a dem operative several of those closest to him told him that the book was true and lindsey graham told him that i would not put words in his mouth and would report as accurately as possible trump decided for reasons that are not clear to me that he would cooperate to his mind he would become a reliable source he is reliable at times completely unreliable at others and often mixed i have tried to guide the reader as best i can but the interviews show he vacillated prevaricated and at times dodged his role as leader of the country despite his i alone can fix it rhetoric as america and the world know trump is an overpowering presence he loves spectacle trump is a living paradox capable of being friendly and appealing he can also be savage and his treatment of people is often almost unbelievable in a time of crisis the operational is much more important than the political or the personal for tens of millions the optimistic american story has turned to a nightmare  my wife elsa walsh who had worked for years as a reporter for the washington post and then as a staff writer for the new yorker and i spent endless hours sifting through the story of the trump presidency talking intensely for the last year what was the remedy the course that could have been taken we asked was there a way to do better elsa suggested looking at a previous president who wanted to speak directly to the american people unfiltered through the media not just during troubling times but during a major crisis the model was franklin d roosevelt over his 12 years as president fdr gave 30 fireside chats his aides and the public often clamored for more fdr said no it was important to limit his talks to the major events and to make them exceptional he also said they were hard work often requiring him to prepare personally for days the evening radio addresses concerned the toughest issues facing the country in a calm and reassuring voice he explained what the problem was what the government was doing about it and what was expected of the people often the message was grim two days after japan’s december 7 1941 surprise bombing attack on pearl harbor fdr spoke to the nation we must share together the bad news and the good news the defeats and the victories—the changing fortunes of war so far the news has been all bad we have suffered a serious setback he added it will not only be a long war it will be a hard war it was a question of survival we are now fighting to maintain our right to live among our world neighbors in freedom and common decency fdr invited the american people in we are all in it—all the way every single man woman and child is a partner in the most tremendous undertaking of our american history japan had inflicted serious damage and the casualty lists would be long sevenday weeks in every war industry would be required on the road ahead there lies hard work—grueling work—day and night every hour and every minute and sacrifice which was a privilege japan was allied with the fascist powers of germany and italy fdr called for a systematic grand strategy a few months later in another fireside chat he asked americans to pull out a world map to follow along with him as he described why the country needed to fight beyond american’s borders your government has unmistakable confidence in your ability to hear the worst without flinching or losing heart her luggage both she squirted from the side of the imperial cruiser ascension’s red harvest and burned atmosphere on her planetward trajectory which distorted the view thus the first time she saw the city with her own flesh eyes not in infofiche or holograph or imagomemory it was haloed in white fire and shone like an endless glittering sea an entire planet rendered into an ecumenopolis palatially urban even its dark spots—older metropolises not yet clad in metal decaying urban blight the harnessed remains of lakes—looked populated only the oceans remained untouched and they gleamed too a brilliantine blueturquoise the city was very beautiful and very big mahit had been on a fair number of planets the ones closest to lsel station that weren’t completely inimical to human life and she was nevertheless overcome by awe her heart beat faster her palms went clammy where they gripped her harness the city appeared exactly as it was always described in teixcalaanli documents and songs the jewel at the heart of the empire complete with atmospheric glow that’s what looking at it is meant to make you think said her imago he was a faint staticky taste on the back of her tongue a flash of grey eyes and sundark skin in her peripheral vision the voice in the back of her head but not quite her voice someone around her age but male and quicksilversmug and as excited to be here as she was she felt her mouth curve in his smile a heavier and wider thing than the muscles in her face preferred they were new to each other his expressions were very strong get out of my nervous system yskandr she thought at him gently chiding an imago—the implanted integrated memory of one’s predecessor housed half in her neurology and half in a small ceramicandmetal machine clasped to her brainstem—wasn’t supposed to take over the host’s nervous system unless the host consented at the beginning of the partnership though consent was complicated the version of yskandr inside her mind remembered having a body and sometimes he used mahit’s as if it were his own she worried about it there was still so much space between them when they were supposed to be becoming one person this time though he withdrew easily sparking prickles electric laughter as you will show me mahit i want to see it again when she gazed down at the city again—closer now the skyport rising to meet her skiff like a flower made of scooping nets—she let the imago look through her eyes and felt his rush of exhilaration as if it were her own what’s down there she thought for you the world said her imago who had been ambassador from lsel in the city when he was still a living person and not part of a long chain of live memory he said it in the teixcalaanli language which made it a tautology the word for world and the word for the city were the same as was the word for empire it was impossible to specify especially in the high imperial dialect one had to note the context yskandr’s context was obfuscating which mahit had come to expect of him she coped despite all her years of studying teixcalaanli language and literature his fluency had a different quality than hers the sort that only came from immersive practice the world he said again but also the edges of the world the empire but also where the empire stops mahit matched his language and spoke out loud in teixcalaanli since there was no one but her in the seedskiff you’ve said something meaningless yes yskandr agreed when i was ambassador it was my habit to say all sorts of meaningless things you should try it it’s quite enjoyable in the privacy of her body yskandr used the most intimate forms of address as if he and mahit were clonesibs or lovers mahit had never spoken them out loud she had a natural younger brother back on lsel station the closest she would ever get to a clonesib but her brother only spoke the stationers’ language and calling him you intimateotherself in teixcalaanli would have been both pointless and unkind she could have said you to a few people who had been in those language and literature courses with her—her old friend and classmate shrja torel would have taken the compliment correctly for instance but mahit and shrja hadn’t spoken since mahit had been picked to be the new ambassador to teixcalaan and carry the imago of the previous one the why of that little breakage between them was obvious and petty and mahit regretted it—and it wasn’t something she was going to get a chance to repair except by apologetic letter from the center of the empire both she and shrja had wanted to see which almost certainly wouldn’t help the city had come closer it filled up the horizon a vast curve she was falling into to yskandr she thought i am the ambassador now i might speak meaningfully if i wanted you speak correctly yskandr said which was the sort of compliment the teixcalaanlitzlim gave to a stillcrèched child gravity caught at the seedskiff and sank into the bones in mahit’s thighs and forearms giving her the sensation of spin it was dizzying below her the skyport’s nets flared open for a moment she thought she was falling that she would fall all the way to the planet’s surface and smear to paste on the ground it was the same for me yskandr said quickly in that stationers’ language that was mahit’s native tongue don’t be afraid mahit you are not falling it is the planet the skyport caught her with hardly a bump she had time to gather herself together there was some business with the seedskiff being shunted into a long line of other such vessels moving along a great conveyor until each one could be identified and come to its assigned gate mahit found herself rehearsing what she would say to the imperial citizens on the other side as if she was a firstyear student preparing for an oral examination in the back of her mind the imago was a watchful thrumming presence every so often he moved her left hand the fingers tapping along her harness someone else’s nervous gesture mahit wished they’d had longer to get used to each other but she hadn’t undergone the normal process of having an imago implanted complete with a year or more of integration therapy under the precise care of one of lsel’s psychotherapists she and yskandr had had a scant three months together and now they were approaching the place where they’d need to work together—work as one person compiled out of a memorychain and a new host when ascension’s red harvest had arrived hanging in parallel orbit around lsel station’s sun and had demanded a new ambassador to take back to teixcalaan they had refused to explain what had happened to the previous one mahit was sure there had been a great deal of politics on the lsel council as to what—and who—to send back and with what demands for information but this she knew was true she herself had been one of the few stationers both old enough for the job and young enough not to have already been brought into an imagoline—and one of the fewer still within that group who had any of the appropriate aptitudes or training for diplomacy of those mahit had been the best her scores on the imperial examinations in teixcalaanli language and literature had approached those of an imperial citizen and she’d been proud of that—spent the half year since the exams imagining that she would come to the city sometime in her middle age once she was established and collect experiences—attending whatever salons were open to noncitizens that season—gathering up information for whoever she’d share her memory with after she died now she’d get to the city all right more important than any teixcalaanli examination her scores on the imagoaptitudes had come up green green green for this match her imago would be yskandr aghavn the previous ambassador to teixcalaan who was now somehow unsuitable to that empire—dead or disgraced or held captive if still alive mahit’s instructions from her government included determining precisely what had gone so wrong with him—but she still had his imago he—or at least the last version of him available to give her fifteen years out of date—was the closest thing lsel could provide to a native guide to the teixcalaanli court not for the first time mahit wondered whether or not there would be a yskandr waiting for her in the flesh when she stepped outside she was not sure which would be easier having one—a disgraced ambassador a competitor for her but perhaps salvageable—or not having one which meant he had died without ever giving to any younger person what he had learned in his lifetime the imagoyskandr in her head was hardly older than she was which was both helpful in finding commonality and uncomfortable—most imagos were elders or victims of earlydeath accidents—but the last record of yskandr’s knowledge and memory had been taken when he’d last returned to lsel on leave from his post in teixcalaan only five years after he had first gone down to the city it had been another decade and a half since then so he was young and so was she and whatever advantage to integration that might have granted the two of them was belied by how short a time they’d been together two weeks between the courier’s arrival and when mahit learned that she’d be the next ambassador three more weeks for her and yskandr to learn how to live together in the body that used to belong to her alone under the supervision of the station’s psychotherapists a long slow time on ascension’s red harvest traversing the sublight distances between the jumpgates that were scattered like jewels throughout teixcalaanli space the seedskiff peeled open like a ripe fruit mahit’s harness retracted taking hold of her luggage in both hands she stepped onto the gate and thus into teixcalaan itself the skyport gate had an airy utilitarianism constructed of wearresistant carpet and clearly marked signage between glassandsteelpaneled walls standing in the center of the gate’s connecting tunnel a precise halfway between the seedskiff and the skyport proper was a single teixcalaanli imperial official in a perfectly cut cream suit she was small narrow at the shoulder and hip much shorter than mahit and she wore her hair in a fishtailbraid queue of black that spilled over her left lapel her sleeves wide like bells shaded through flameorange at the upper arm—information ministry coloring yskandr told mahit—down to the deep red cuffs that were the privilege of the titled members of the court over her left eye she wore a cloudhook a glass eyepiece full of the ceaseless obscuring flow of the imperial information network hers was sleekly decorative much like the rest of her her large dark eyes and thin cheekbones and mouth were more delicate than was fashionable on teixcalaan but by mahit’s stationer standards she was interesting if not quite pretty she touched her fingers together politely in front of her chest and inclined her head to mahit yskandr lifted mahit’s own hands to make the same gesture—and mahit dropped the two bags she’d been carrying on the floor with an embarrassing clatter she was horrified they hadn’t slipped like that since the first week they’d been together fuck she thought and heard at the same moment yskandr say fuck the doubling wasn’t reassuring the official’s carefully neutral expression did not change she said ambassador i am three seagrass asekreta and patrician secondclass it is my honor to welcome you into the jewel of the world i will be serving as your cultural liaison at the command of his imperial majesty six direction there was a long pause and then the official gave a small sigh and went on do you require some sort of assistance with your belongings three seagrass was an oldfashioned teixcalaanli name the numeral half was low value and the noun half was the name of a plant even if it was a plant mahit hadn’t seen used in a name before all of the noun parts of teixcalaanli names were plants or tools or inanimate objects but most of the plant ones were flowers seagrass was memorable asekreta meant she was not only information ministry as her suit suggested but a trained agent of rank as well as holding the court title of patrician secondclass an aristocrat but not a very important or rich one mahit left her hands where yskandr had put them which was where they belonged no matter how angry she was at how they’d gotten there and bowed over them ambassador mahit dzmare of lsel station at your service and that of his majesty may his reign be a radiant blaze upon the void since this was her first official contact with a member of the teixcalaanli court she used the imperial honorific she’d picked carefully in consultation with yskandr and the council government on lsel radiant blaze was the epithet for the emperor twelve solarflare in the expansion history as attributed to pseudothirteen river the oldest account of imperial presence in stationer space using it now was thus a sign of both mahit’s erudition and her respect for six direction and his office but the void carefully avoided any intimation of teixcalaanli claim on parts of stationer space which were not in fact space whether three seagrass was aware of the implications of reference was somewhat difficult to tell she waited patiently while mahit scooped up her luggage again and then said keep a tight grip on those you are urgently awaited in the judiciary concerning the previous ambassador and you may need to greet all sorts of people along the way fine mahit wouldn’t underestimate three seagrass’s capability to be snide nor her capability to be clever she nodded and when the other woman turned smartly and walked up the tunnel she followed don’t underestimate any of them yskandr said a cultural liaison has been at court for half as long as you’ve been alive she earned the post don’t lecture me when you’ve just made me look like a flustered barbarian do you want me to apologize are you sorry mahit could imagine his facial expression all too easily arch as calm as a teixcalaanlitzlim the lusher mouth she remembered from holographs of him dragging her own lips up and askew i wouldn’t want you to feel like a barbarian you’ll get enough of that from them he wasn’t sorry it was marginally possible that he was embarrassed but if he was he wasn’t feeling it with her endocrine system  yskandr got her through the next half hour mahit couldn’t even resent him for it he behaved exactly like an imago ought to behave a repository of instinctive and automatic skill that mahit hadn’t had time to acquire for herself he knew when to duck through doorways built for teixcalaanlitzlim instead of stationers when to avert her eyes from the rising glare of the city reflected in the glass of the elevator that crawled down the outside of the skyport how high to step to climb into three seagrass’s groundcar he performed courtesy ritual like a native after the incident with the luggage he was careful about actually moving mahit’s hands but she let him have charge of how long she maintained eye contact and with whom the degree to which her head was inclined in greeting all the little ways of signaling that she was less of an alien less of a barbarian something that might belong in the city protective coloration going native without ever having to be a native she could feel curious eyes slide off of her and fixate on the far more interesting court dress of three seagrass and wondered how much yskandr had loved the city to be this good at being in it in the groundcar three seagrass asked have you been within the world long mahit needed to stop thinking in any language but teixcalaanli what three seagrass meant was a standard bit of politesse small talk a have you ever been to my country before and mahit had heard it like an existential question no she said but i have read the classics since i was a very small child and i have thought often of the city three seagrass seemed to approve of this answer i wouldn’t want to bore you ambassador she said but if you’d like a brief and verbal tour of what we’re passing by i’d be pleased to recite an appropriate poem she flicked a control button on her side of the car and the windows faded to transparency i couldn’t be bored mahit said honestly outside the city was a blur of steel and pale stone neon lights crawling up and down the glass walls of its skyscrapers they were on one of the central ring roads spiraling inward through municipal buildings toward the palace itself properly it was more of a citywithinacity than a palace by statistics it had several hundred thousand inhabitants all of whom were responsible in some minute fashion for the functioning of the empire from the gardeners on up to six direction himself each of them plugged into the information network that was guaranteed to imperial citizens and every last one bathed in a constant flow of data that told them where to be what to do how the story of their day and week and epoch would go three seagrass had an excellent voice she was reciting the buildings—a seventeenthousandline poem which described the city’s architecture mahit didn’t know the precise version she’d picked to declaim but that might have been mahit’s own fault she had her own favorite narrative poems from the teixcalaanli canon and she’d memorized as many of them as she could in imitation of teixcalaanli literati and to pass the oral portions of the examinations but the buildings had always seemed too dull to bother with it was different now hearing three seagrass recite it as they passed the structures being described she was a fluent orator and she had enough command of the metrical scheme to add amusing and relevant original detail where improvisation was appropriate mahit folded her hands across her lap and watched the poetry going by through the glass windows of the groundcar this was the city then the jewel of the world the heart of the empire a collapse between narrative and perception three seagrass making adjustments on the fly to the canonical buildings when some building had changed after some time she realized that yskandr was reciting along with three seagrass a dim whisper in the back of her mind and also that she found the whisper reassuring he knew this poem and thus she knew it too if she needed to know it that was what imagolines were for after all making sure useful memory was preserved generation to generation they traveled through fortyfive minutes and two traffic snarls before three seagrass concluded her stanza and stopped the groundcar at the base of a needlelike pillar of a building quite near the center of the palace grounds judiciary complex yskandr said good sign or bad sign mahit asked him it depends i wonder what i did something illegal come on yskandr give me a general sense of the possibilities here what would you do to get yourself thrown in jail mahit got the impression of yskandr sighing at her but also the queasy sensation of someone else’s nervousness setting off her adrenal glands mm sedition mostly she wished she could be sure he was joking surrounding the pillar of the judiciary was a perimeter of greyuniformed guards clustered more closely at the door a security checkpoint the guards carried long slim dark grey sticks rather than the energy weapons that the teixcalaanli legions favored mahit had seen a lot of the latter on ascension’s red harvest but not these shocksticks yskandr said electricitybased crowd control—these were not here when i was last here they’re antiriot gear or at least they are in tabloid entertainments you’re fifteen years out of date mahit thought a lot might have changed— this is the center of the palace if they’re worried about riots at the judiciary something hasn’t changed something is wrong now go find out what i did mahit wondered what had gone sufficiently wrong to create security theater at the door of the judiciary and if yskandr had helped it go that wrong—felt prickles go up the back of her spine and down through her arms the ulnar nerves crawling unpleasantly—and then had no time for more distressing reflection as three seagrass was escorting her through she offered up her thumbprints as well as mahit’s and stood with her eyes politely averted as a teixcalaanli security guard patted chastely at the pockets of mahit’s traveling jacket and her trousers her luggage was decorously placed in their custody and she was promised that she could have it back on her way out once the guard was done breaking all of mahit’s personal space taboos she advised mahit to avoid wandering off without escort as her identity was neither recorded on cloudhook nor otherwise authorized to be present within the judiciary mahit raised an inquiring eyebrow at three seagrass there were questions of speed three seagrass said proceeding briskly through a multiplicity of irising doors into a cool slatefloored interior toward the elevator bank your registration and permission to move about the palace complex will of course be taken care of as soon as is possible mahit said i’ve been in transit more than a month and there are questions of speed we have been waiting for three months ambassador since we sent for a new representative from the station i must have done something quite spectacular yskandr said down below are secret courts and interrogation chambers or so the palace rumors always went the elevator chimed in fourths and one more hour matters after three months three seagrass gestured for mahit to precede her into the elevator which was a sort of answer if not an informative one they descended waiting for them below was a chamber that could have been a courtroom or an operating theater bluemetal floor and amphitheaterstyle benches arrayed around a high table on which lay some large object covered in a sheet floodlights three teixcalaanli strangers all broadcheekboned and broadshouldered one in a red cassock one dressed identically to three seagrass in the orangeandcream of the information ministry and one in a dark grey suit that reminded mahit of nothing so much as the metal sheen of the shocksticks they stood around the table arguing in low rapid voices and blocked mahit’s view of whatever was lying on it i still would like to make my own examination for my ministry before he’s returned said the information ministry courtier annoyed there’s not a single good reason to just turn him back over to them the teixcalaanlitzlim in red said with some finality it won’t do us any good and might spark an incident— dark grey suit disagreed contrary to the opinions of your ministry ixplanatl i am entirely certain that any incident they could induce wouldn’t be more trouble than an insect bite and as easily soothed oh for fuck’s sake argue later said the one from information they’re here the man in red turned toward them as they entered as if he had been anticipating their arrival the ceiling was a low dome mahit thought of a bubble of gas trapped under the earth then she understood the shape on the table as a corpse it lay under a thin sheet drawn midway up its bare torso hands resting on its chest fingertips touching as if it was preparing to greet some afterlife its cheeks were sunken and its open eyes were filmed over with a hazy blue the same color had infiltrated its lips and nailbeds it looked like it had been dead a long time perhaps … three months as clearly as if he had been standing next to her mahit heard yskandr say i got old with wondering horror she was shaking her heart raced drowning out the sound of three seagrass introducing her a dizzying rush worse than falling toward the planet panic out of nowhere not her panic yskandr’s her imago flooding her with her own stress hormones enough adrenaline to taste metallic the mouth of the corpse was slack but she could see the smile lines at its corners feel on her own mouth how yskandr’s muscles would have formed them over time as you see ambassador dzmare said the man in red whose name mahit had completely failed to catch during the introductions a new ambassador was necessary i apologize for preserving him in this fashion but we did not want to disrespect any funereal processes which your people might prefer she came closer the corpse stayed dead stayed still and limp and empty fuck yskandr said a fizz of nauseating static mahit was horribly helplessly sure she was going to throw up oh fuck i can’t do this mahit thought or yskandr thought—she was having trouble keeping them apart and this wasn’t how the integration was supposed to go she was never supposed to be lost inside his biochemical panic response hijacking her own endocrine system about how the only place that yskandr existed now was inside her head she’d considered that he was dead when teixcalaan had demanded a new ambassador thought about it intellectually planned for it and yet—here he was—a corpse a hollow rotting shell and she was panicking because her imago was panicking and an emotionspike was the easiest way to fuck up an integration that wasn’t finished an emotionspike would burn out all the tiny microcircuits in the machine in her mind and oh fuck he was dead and oh fuck i am dead and the blur the nauseating blur of everything yskandr she tried aiming for comfort and missing by a long distance get closer he told her i need to see i’m not sure— he moved them before she could decide to do what he asked it was like she’d blacked out for the space of time it took to approach the corpse blinked and was there and this was going so very very awry and she couldn’t stop it— we burn our dead she said and didn’t know who to thank for the fact that she’d said it in the right language how interesting a custom said the courtier in dark grey mahit thought he was from the judiciary itself this was likely to be his morgue even if it was the man in red who was the mortician mahit smiled at him too wide for her face and too uncontrolled for yskandr’s an expression that’d horrify any serene teixcalaanlitzlim afterward she said searching for the correct vocabulary a spar to cling to through the roiling waves of adrenaline we eat the ashes as a sacred thing his children and successors first if he had any the courtier had the grace to blanch and the stubbornness to repeat himself how interesting a custom what do you do with yours mahit asked she came nearer yskandr’s corpse drifting her mouth seemed to be under her control for the moment but her feet belonged to yskandr excuse my inquiry i am after all not a citizen the man in red said burial is common as if it was a question he answered every day do you wish to examine the body ambassador is there some reason i should do so mahit said but she was already pulling down the sheet her fingers were sweating slick on the fabric underneath the corpse was naked a fortyish man with all of his skin tinged that same blue at its most translucent points an injectable preservative all through him the injection points were strikingly visible holes surrounded by a halo of pale swollen flesh—at the carotid and in the ulnar veins of both arms there was an extra injection site at the base of the corpse’s right thumb distorting the shape of the hand she found herself staring at it in another one of those blankedout moments—she’d been looking at his face and now she was looking at his wrist as if the imago needed to see every place his former body had been altered even if mahit had wanted to claim her rights as his successor to the dust of his flesh—and she wasn’t sure she wanted to—she thought that it might be a very stupid idea to ingest whatever the man in red had filled him up with three months without rotting she could taste bile in her throat under the metallic endocrine cascade bodies should decompose and be recycled but the empire preserved everything told the same stories over and over again why not also preserve flesh instead of rendering it up for decent use she was touching the wrist the imago tracing her fingertip over the injection site and then further into the palm following the line of some scar the flesh was rubbery plasticky too much give and not enough all at once—her yskandr hadn’t gotten that scar yet her yskandr wasn’t dead yet—there was another one of those dizzying nauseous waves the edges of her vision irising to fizz and sparks and she thought again we are going to blow out all the circuitry stop it— i can’t yskandr said again an enormous negation inside her mind an avulsion that felt like a spark gone to ground—and then he was gone dead quiet not even the feeling of him watching through mahit’s eyes she felt gravityless full of endorphins she hadn’t produced on purpose and horribly alone her tongue was heavy it tasted like aluminum nothing like this had ever happened to her before how did he die she asked and was amazed that she sounded entirely normal entirely unfazed asked for the sake of continuing to talk none of the teixcalaanli knew about imagos none of them would even be able to understand what had just happened to her he choked on the air the man in red said touching the corpse’s neck with a practiced span of two fingers his throat closed it was very unfortunate but the physiologies of noncitizens are often so different from ours he ate something he was allergic to mahit asked this seemed absurd she was shocknumb and apparently yskandr had died of anaphylaxis and if she wasn’t careful she was going to have a hysterical laughing fit at dinner with the minister for science ten pearl no less said the last courtier the one from information this one looked like he’d climbed out of a classical teixcalaanli painting his features were unbelievably symmetrical lush mouth low forehead perfectly hooked nose eyes like deep brown pools you should have seen the newsfeeds afterward ambassador it was quite the tabloid story twelve azalea means no disrespect said three seagrass from where she stood by the door the news went no farther than the palace complex it would be inappropriate for the general population mahit pulled the sheet back up to the corpse’s chin it didn’t help he was still there was the story also inappropriate for the stations she asked the courier who asked for my service within the city was unnecessarily vague three seagrass shrugged a minute shift of one shoulder ambassador while i am asekreta not every asekreta is privy to the decisions of the information ministry as a whole what would you like done with his body inquired the man in red mahit looked up at him he was tall for a teixcalaanlitzlim his eyes an unnervingly friendly green were almost even with hers she had no idea what to do with a corpse she had never burnt anyone herself she was too young her parents were both still living and besides what you did was you called the funeral manager and they handled it preferably while someone you loved held your hand and cried with you over the mutual loss she had less idea what to do with this corpse no one was going to cry over yskandr even her and there weren’t any funeral managers in teixcalaanli space who would know where to begin she managed nothing yet and swallowed hard against the remains of the nausea her fingers felt electric all prickleshimmer where they had touched the dead man’s skin i will of course make arrangements once i am better acquainted with the facilities available until then well he’s not going to rot is he only very slowly the man in red said sir— mahit looked to three seagrass for help she was a cultural liaison so she could damn well liaise— ixplanatl four lever three seagrass said obligingly of the science ministry four lever mahit went on dropping the man’s title—it meant scientist in a very general sense scientistwithcredentials—entirely on purpose when will the rot be noticeable another two months perhaps four lever smiled enough to show off a sliver of teeth two years ambassador excellent mahit said that will be plenty of time four lever bowed over the triangular press of his fingertips as if she’d given him an order mahit suspected she was being indulged she’d take it she had to she needed space enough to think and she wasn’t going to get it here in the bowels of the judiciary with three courtiers and a ixplanatl morgue attendant all waiting for her to make some irrevocable error and end up like yskandr had betrayed by his own physiology after twenty years of living in the city eating what the teixcalaanlitzlim ate did she believe it yskandr she thought at the blank place where the imago ought to be what did you get us into before you died he didn’t answer reaching for the blank spot made her feel like she was falling even though she knew her feet were steady on the floor i would like said mahit to three seagrass slow and even and in the correct language trying to hide the vertigo and the fear to be registered as the legal ambassador from the stations to teixcalaan and also to see to my luggage she wanted to get out of here as fast as possible naturally ambassador said three seagrass ixplanatl twelve azalea twentynine infograph as ever your company is a pleasure as is yours three seagrass said twelve azalea enjoy the ambassador three seagrass did that oneshoulder shrug again as if nothing anyone had said could affect an asekreta of the court in a fashion that mattered mahit liked her abruptly and was aware that the liking was more of a desperate grasp at an ally than anything else she was so alone without the imago talking to her surely he’d come back in a moment once the shock was over once the emotionspike had faded it was fine she was fine she wasn’t even dizzy anymore shall we then she said dumb metal of station walls and hadn’t that made her a popular and cheerful childhood companion—not that it mattered think like a teixcalaanlitzlim incriminating information would have been removed or made innocuous or yskandr had hidden it if he’d known what was about to happen to him or suspected if he was smart the imago was smart but the imago was out of date a man might change in fifteen years mahit wondered what she’d be like if she lived that long in this place especially without the imago—more important than out of date the imago was gone unless he came back of course he’d come back this was a minor flicker an error she’d wake up tomorrow and he’d be here she was going to have to think about sabotage right along with incriminating something had gone wrong with her imagomachine—either sabotage or mechanical failure or personal failure to integrate it could be her own fault her own psychology rejecting his she shuddered her hands still felt prickly and strange your luggage is processed and yours again said three seagrass coming through the irised door of yskandr’s bedroom mahit sat up very straight and tried to look like she was absolutely not having a possible neurological incident not a single bit of contraband you are a very dull barbarian so far were you expecting excitement mahit asked you’re my very first barbarian three seagrass said i am expecting everything surely you’ve met noncitizens before this is the jewel of the world meeting is not the same as liaisingfor you’re my noncitizen ambassador i open doors for you the verb form she used was just archaic enough to be idiomatic mahit risked sounding less fluent than she hoped she was and said dooropening seems beneath the responsibilities i’d expect of a patrician secondclass three seagrass’s smile was sharper than most teixcalaanli expressions it reached her eyes you don’t have a cloudhook you can’t open some doors ambassador the city doesn’t know you’re real besides without me how will you decrypt your mail mahit raised an eyebrow my mail is encrypted and three months late in being answered that said mahit standing up and walking out of the bedroom—this door knew her at least—is ambassador yskandr aghavn’s mail not mine three seagrass trailed behind her there isn’t a difference ambassador dzmare ambassador aghavn she said tilting one hand back and forth it’s the ambassador’s mail there was less of a difference than even three seagrass knew or would be if the imago would ever come back mahit was she realized pissed off at him besides being worried about mechanical failure all he’d done was panic at seeing himself dead run her through an adrenaline crisis and give her the strangest headache of her life and now she was alone with all of the unanswered mail his fifteenyearsmoreteixcalaanli self had abandoned via being almostcertainlymurdered and a cultural liaison with a sense of humor and it’s encrypted of course it wouldn’t be very respectful to not encrypt an ambassador’s mail three seagrass retrieved a bowl brimming with infofiche sticks little rectangles of wood or metal or plastic surrounding circuitry each one elaborately decorated with its sender’s personal iconography she fished out a fistful holding them between her fingers like her knuckles had sprouted claws what would you like to start with if the mail is addressed to me i ought to read it myself said mahit legally i’m an absolute equivalent three seagrass said pleasantly enough pleasantness wasn’t sufficient just because mahit wanted an ally—wanted three seagrass to be helpful and useful and not an immediate threat considering the woman had to live in the next room and open doors for however long she’d been assigned to mind mahit considering that mahit was beginning to realize how trapped she was going to be in the city considering that she was not real to that city’s panopticon eyes—just because mahit wanted wasn’t enough to make three seagrass an actual extension of mahit’s will no matter what she said she was perhaps by teixcalaanli law mahit said by stationer law you are nothing of the kind ambassador i hope you aren’t assuming i’m not trustworthy enough to guide you through the court mahit shrugged spreading her hands wide what happened to my predecessor’s cultural liaison she asked if three seagrass was disturbed by the question the disturbance didn’t reach her face impassive she said he was reassigned after his two years of service were up i believe he is no longer in the palace complex at all what was his name mahit asked if yskandr was with her she would have known those two years of service would have been his first two years in the city well within the five years that the imago remembered fifteen engine i think said three seagrass easily enough—and mahit had to clutch at the edge of yskandr’s desk hang on to it flooded with a complex of emotion out of nowhere fondness and frustration the echo of a face wearing a cloudhook set in a bronze frame that filled up his entire left eye socket from cheekbone to browbone fifteen engine as yskandr the imago remembered him memoryflash memoryswarm and mahit reached for the imago thought yskandr and got nothing three seagrass was staring at her she wondered what she looked like pale probably and distracted i would like to speak to him fifteen engine i assure you said three seagrass i have extensive experience and really unusually excellent scores on all the necessary aptitudes for working with noncitizens i’m sure we’ll be fine asekreta— please call me three seagrass ambassador i’m your liaison three seagrass said mahit trying very hard not to raise her voice i would like to ask your predecessor about how my predecessor conducted his business here and perhaps also about the circumstances of his extremely untimely and based on the quantity of this mail inconvenient death ah said three seagrass yes his death was quite as you say inconvenient but entirely accidental i’m sure but he was my predecessor mahit said knowing that if three seagrass was as teixcalaanli as she seemed a request to know the intimate details of the person who had held one’s own position in society would be culturally compelling like asking to know about a prospective imago would be on lsel station and i would like to speak to someone who knew him as well as we are going to get to know one another she tried to remember the muscle memory of the precise degree to which yskandr had widened her eyes in a teixcalaanlistyle smile and imitated it by feel ambassador i have every sympathy with your current—predicament said three seagrass and i’ll have a message sent to fifteen engine wherever he might be now along with the rest of the answered mail … which i can’t answer myself because it is encrypted yes but i can decrypt nearly any of the standard forms and most of the nonstandard ones you still haven’t explained why my mail is encrypted in a fashion i can’t decrypt well said three seagrass i don’t at all mean to be disparaging i’m sure that on your station you are an extremely educated person but in the city encryption is usually based in poetic cipher and we certainly don’t expect noncitizens to have to learn that and an ambassador’s mail is encrypted for the sake of showing off that an ambassador is an intelligent person wellacquainted with courts and court poetry—it’s customary it’s not a real cipher it’s a game we do have poetry out on lsel you know i know said three seagrass with such sympathy that mahit wanted to shake her but here look at this one she held up a scarlet lacquered infofiche stick its two parts held closed with a round gold wax seal embossed with the stylized image of the city—the teixcalaanli imperial symbol it’s definitely for you it’s dated today she cracked the seal and the infofiche spilled into the air between them a stream of holographic wordshapes in teixcalaanli script that mahit felt like she ought to be able to understand she’d been reading imperial literature since she was a child three seagrass touched her cloudhook and said i bet you could decrypt this kind by hand actually—do you know political verse fifteensyllable iambic couplets with a caesura between syllable eight and syllable nine said mahit realizing only as she spoke that she sounded more like a candidate in an oral exam than a knowledgeable subject of teixcalaan but having no idea how to stop sounding so it’s easy yes so the cipher for most communication at court is a straight transposition with the opening four couplets of whoever’s written the best encomiastic poem—that’s praise poetry which i’m sure you do know if you can count syllables and caesuras—from last season it’s been two calendar’s ‘reclamation song’ for months now i can get you a copy if you really want to decrypt your own mail i would certainly like to hear what the city thinks is the best encomiastic poetry going mahit said three seagrass snorted you’re great you could have been born here with that attitude mahit did not feel complimented what does it say she asked three seagrass narrowed her eyes—her pupils tracked to the left and up in tiny jerks micromuscular instructions to her cloudhook—and peered intently at the infofiche formal invitation to the emperor’s own salon and oration contest hosted within a presentational diplomatic banquet in three days i’ll assume you want to go why wouldn’t i well if you want to insult all your predecessor’s contacts and establish that lsel station is hostile to imperial interests not coming to dinner is a wonderful start mahit leaned in quite close close enough that she could feel the warm pulse of three seagrass’s breath on her face and smiled with all her teeth as barbaric as possible mahit watched her try to stay still and not flinch back spotted the moment when she succeeded rationalized what was happening three seagrass mahit said then how about we assume that i’m not an idiot we could do that three seagrass said do your people invade personal space as a reprimand on a regular basis when necessary mahit said and in exchange i will assume you’re not involved in an obvious attempt at diplomatic sabotage that seems like a fair trade so i’m accepting his imperial majesty’s gracious invitation send the message and i’ll sign it and then we need to get through the rest of this backlog of infofiche  the backlog took the rest of the afternoon and stretched on into the evening most of it was the usual sort of communication for a minor but still politically significant ambassadorial office—information requests from the chancellery and from universities concerning the habits economics and tourist opportunities available at lsel protocol queries repatriation requests from stationers who had been living in teixcalaanli space and wanted to stop—mahit signed those—and a smaller batch of entrance queries which she approved and sent onward to one of the imperial offices concerned with barbarian entry visas an unexpectedly high number of halfauthorized safepassagethroughstationerspace visas for teixcalaanli military transport—all of them stamped with yskandr’s personal seal but few of them actually signed by him the halfauthorized copies didn’t mean anything they weren’t done it was as if yskandr had been interrupted in the process of officially allowing half a legion’s worth of teixcalaanli ships into lsel territory mahit spared a moment to wonder at the sheer number of them and why they hadn’t all been sealed and signed at the same time and set them aside for a quieter moment of contemplation she wasn’t prepared to send teixcalaanli warships through her station’s sector without doing some research as to why they wanted to move in such quantity no matter what yskandr had been doing when he died none of the requests were for ascension’s red harvest someone other than yskandr must have approved that ship’s journey to pick her up but then yskandr had already been dead by the time that request needed to be processed mahit felt mildly ill someone had sent that ship—she should find out who— but three seagrass handed her the next infofiche stick which turned out to be a thoroughly distracting mess concerning import fees on a shipping manifest that would have taken half an hour to sort out had it been answered when it was originally asked back when yskandr had been alive it took nearly three times that long for mahit to solve considering one of the parties had left the planet—that was the stationer—and another had married into citizenship and changed his name during the lag time mahit made three seagrass hunt down the newmade teixcalaanlitzlim under his new name and issue him a formal summons to the judicial department of interstellar trade licensing just make sure he shows up to pay the import fees on the cargo he bought from one of my station’s citizens whatever his name is mahit told her the name the man had chosen it turned out was thirtysix allterrain tundra vehicle a revelation that produced in both mahit and three seagrass a kind of stunned silence no one would actually name a child that three seagrass complained after a moment he has no taste even if his parent or his crèche was from a lowtemperature planet with a lot of tundra in need of allterrain vehicles mahit wrinkled her eyebrows in sudden puzzlement remembering—vividly—the part of her early language training on lsel when her entire class had been encouraged to make up teixcalaanli names to call themselves while they were learning to speak she’d picked nine orchid because the heroine of her thenfavorite teixcalaanli novel about the adventures of the crèchemate of the future emperor twelve solarflare had been called five orchid it had felt very teixcalaanli picking a name based on one’s favorite book she’d thought the names the other children had chosen were much less successful at the time and had felt very superior now in the center of teixcalaanli space the entire episode seemed not only appropriative but absurd nevertheless she asked three seagrass just how do you teixcalaanlitzlim name yourselves numbers are for luck or the qualities you want your child to have or fashion ‘three’ is perennially popular all the low numbers are threes are supposed to be stable and innovative like a triangle doesn’t fall over can reach pinnacles of thought that sort of thing this person picking ‘thirtysix’ is just trying to look newmoney citydweller it’s a little silly but not that bad the bad part is ‘allterrain tundra vehicle’ i mean blood and sunlight it’s technically permissible that’s an inanimate object or a piece of architecture but it’s so … nice names are plants and flowers and natural phenomena and not so many syllables this was the most animated mahit had seen three seagrass be so far and it was really making it difficult for mahit not to like her she was funny thirtysix allterrain tundra vehicle was funnier when i was learning the language she said deciding all at once to share to offer something back for this little bit of cultural exchange—if they were going to work together they should work together—we had to pretend to have teixcalaanlistyle names and one of my classmates—the kind of person who scores perfectly on exams and has a terrible accent—called himself 2e asteroid the irrational number he thought he was being clever three seagrass contemplated this and then snickered he was she said that’s hilarious really enormously it’s like turning your whole persona into a selfdeprecating joke i’d buy a novel written by a twoe asteroid it’d probably be satire mahit laughed the person in question wasn’t subtle enough for satire she said he was a dreadful classmate he sounds it three seagrass agreed but he’s accidentally subtle which is even better and then she handed over the next infofiche stick and began to decrypt the next problem mahit needed to solve the whole afternoon was—work work mahit was good at work she had been trained to do even if the forms of it were obscure and teixcalaanli and required three seagrass’s decryption skills at sunset three seagrass ordered them both small bowls of a spiced meat in dumpling wrappers covered in a creamy semifermented sauce laced with red oil assuring mahit that it was extremely unlikely that she would be allergic to anything in the meal it’s ixhui she explained we feed it to babies if i die no one will answer the mail for three more months and then where will you be mahit said stabbing a dumpling with the twopronged fork the meal had come with it burst when she bit into it tangy and warm the red oil was finely spiced just hot enough to linger on her tongue and make her wonder about neurotoxic effects before it faded to pleasantness she was abruptly starving she hadn’t eaten since the cruiser it was somewhat gratifying to see three seagrass devour her own bowl of ixhui with a similar level of enthusiasm mahit waved the fork at her this is too good for babies she said three seagrass widened her eyes in a teixcalaanli version of a grin work food anything that’s too delicious to eat slow and then you get back to the job faster you’re getting the idea mahit tilted her head to the side you’re the sort of person who works all the time aren’t you it’s in the job description ambassador call me mahit please mahit said and surely there are cultural liaisons less helpful three seagrass nearly looked pleased oh lots but cultural liaison’s my assignment asekreta’s the job intelligence protocol secrets—and oratory if all the literature about the city mahit had ever read hadn’t lied to her and that job is politics said three seagrass a close enough correspondence to the literature why don’t you tell me about these military transport visas then mahit started just as the door to the suite chimed in a chord that made mahit wince but seemed not to strike three seagrass as lacking any euphony three seagrass went to the door and punched in a code on the wallkeypad next to it mahit watched her fingers and tried to internalize as much of the sequence as possible surely she would be able to operate the door codes to her own suite unless she was more of a prisoner than she thought how narrow were the city’s definitions of real people who could move through it she wished she could ask yskandr the wallkeypad satisfied projected an image of the face of the person waiting outside his name and string of titles floating above his head in blocky goldlimned glyphs young broadcheeked bronze skin a thick dark hairline over the short forehead all the imperial art seemed to prefer mahit recognized him from the mortuary viewing hall twelve azalea indistinguishable courtier number three except for how looking at him gave mahit the impression of being in the presence of some other culture’s impeccably observed standard of masculine beauty she felt a little peculiar about her lack of response he was like an art object twelve azalea patrician firstclass three seagrass had said which meant she knew him by name at least and possibly by something closer to reputation i haven’t any idea what he wants three seagrass said which did suggest that reputation was somewhat of a factor mahit said let him in three seagrass pressed her thumb to the wallkeypad firmly what if it was fingerprintlocked but surely the teixcalaanli wouldn’t use technology that primitive and the door admitted twelve azalea in a sweep of orange sleeves and cream lapels mahit braced herself for the full sequence of greeting protocols without any help from yskandr she was supposed to not have to worry about these things but had only begun to introduce herself when twelve azalea said i came to your suite we really don’t have to bother brushed past three seagrass leaving an affectionate kiss on her temple and a look of profound annoyance on her face and sat down on the divan ambassador dzmare he said welcome to the jewel of the world a pleasure three seagrass settled next to him wideeyed the corners of her mouth visibly tilted up i thought we weren’t doing formalities petal she said lacking formalities hasn’t robbed me of being polite reed twelve azalea said and then turned a large unteixcalaanli smile on mahit it made him appear slightly unhinged i hope she hasn’t been too rude to you ambassador petal must you three seagrass said they had pet names for one another it was … cute and simultaneously hilarious and embarrassing not rude at all mahit said earning her a theatrically grateful look from three seagrass welcome to the diplomatic territory of lsel station how might i help you other than letting you renew your acquaintance with my liaison twelve azalea took on an expression of concern which mahit suspected was a thin veil over a more unsavory—and more honest—excited interest it was inconvenient in the utmost that every single teixcalaanlitzlim was going to assume she was as astute as an airlock door recognizing only the surface images of people uniforms and expressions of concern she wondered how long it would take before anyone at all would take her seriously i have some worrisome information said twelve azalea concerning the corpse of your predecessor well perhaps seriously began now and perhaps she’d been right to immediately assume yskandr could not have died by accident it wasn’t like him and it wasn’t like the city to be so straightforward is there a problem with his body possibly said twelve azalea gesturing as if to suggest that there was certainly a problem and it was a matter of determining its exact nature as if you’d get involved in my business for just possibly petal three seagrass said i would suggest that the body of my predecessor is my business mahit said we covered this mahit three seagrass said briskly legal equivalency— but not moral or ethical equivalency said mahit especially involving a lsel citizen as my predecessor certainly was what is the problem after ixplanatl four lever left the operating theater i stayed a little while with the corpse and availed myself of the theater’s imaging equipment twelve azalea said my current assignment within the information ministry—i have been working with noncitizens on their medical and accessibility needs while they are visiting us here—has made me quite curious about the physiologies of noncitizens—some are quite different from human people not that i’m implying lsel station isn’t human ambassador nothing of the kind but i am insatiably curious you can ask reed she’s known me since we were cadet asekretim together insatiably curious and often in large amounts of trouble especially if it involves interesting forensics or peculiar medical practices three seagrass said mahit could see the lines of tension in her jaw the sharpening angle of her mouth get to the point did two rosewood send you to check up on me as if i’d run errands reed even for the minister for information the point is that i stayed behind and examined the corpse of the ambassador’s predecessor and that corpse is not entirely organic what said three seagrass at the same time as mahit found herself struggling to keep her mouth shut around a stationer expletive how so she asked perhaps yskandr had replaced a failing hip joint that would be innocuous and explicable and more easily noticeable than the implant nestled at the base of his skull that had first given him his own imago and then had recorded an imprint of his knowledge and self and memory—the imagoimprint which was meant to be passed on down the line his brain is full of metal twelve azalea said denying her even that brief moment of hope shrapnel three seagrass inquired there were no wounds trust me wounds would have been noticed by the morgue attendant a fullbody scan on the imager is much more complete i can’t think why it hadn’t been done previously—perhaps it was just so obvious that the ambassador had died of anaphylaxis— i am interested in your immediate assumption that shrapnel is a possibility said mahit quickly trying to steer the conversation away from its most dangerous aspects it would help if she knew what if anything yskandr had exposed about the imago process—but she couldn’t even ask her version of him and how was that version to know what his … continuation his continuation that would do—what he had done in the time which had elapsed between them the city is occasionally hostile said three seagrass there are accidents added twelve azalea more lately a person misoperates their cloudhook the city overreacts… it isn’t a problem you’ll ever need to deal with three seagrass said with a blithe reassurance that mahit did not believe at all did my predecessor have a cloudhook she asked i have no idea said three seagrass he’d have to have been granted permission to use one from his majesty six direction himself noncitizens don’t have them—it’s a right having a connection to the city it comes with being teixcalaanli it came with being teixcalaanli and having one opened doors and also apparently brought a person into a certain sphere of heightened risk mahit wondered just how well the cloudhooks tracked teixcalaanli citizens as they moved around and who exactly kept track of that information what the former ambassador has got cloudhook or not twelve azalea interrupted is a very large quantity of mysterious metal in his brainstem and i thought perhaps you ambassador would like to know before someone tries to install some in yours cheerful as always petal who else knows about this mahit asked twelve azalea said i haven’t told anyone and folded his hands demurely in the long sleeves of his jacket mahit could hear the yet implicit in that statement and wondered what this person wanted from her why did you tell me the ambassador might have had all sorts of implants—an epileptic pacemaker for instance—those are common if epilepsy develops late in life she said deploying the standard lie about an imagomachine to someone who wasn’t from lsel i assume you have them here in a civilization as great as teixcalaan you could have looked up the ambassador’s medical records and found out without going to all this trouble would you believe me if i said i wanted to see what you’d do your predecessor was—mm quite a political man for an ambassador i am curious to see if all lsel people are i’m not yskandr mahit said and felt as she said it acutely ashamed—she should have been more yskandr if they’d had time to integrate—if he hadn’t disappeared inside her head ‘political’ varies does the ixplanatl know you think twelve azalea smiled enough to show his teeth he didn’t mention it to you or to me but he is a ixplanatl of the medical college of the science ministry—who is to say what he thinks is important i want said mahit standing up to see this for myself twelve azalea looked up at her delighted oh you are political after all  two despite a long history of promising myself that today was going to be the day that i was going to quit that this was the absolute last time i was going to drink snort or inject and failing to follow through i kept at my new fitness program like most people i had a complicated relationship with the notion of quitting i was used to abandoning things that were painful as well as refusing to give up what gave me pleasure but ultimately led to my suicide attempt i’d been in and out of five different rehabilitation programs done my time in aa crafted my own no morenever again efforts to quit using and drinking but always every time sooner or later the siren song of substance abuse proved more powerful than my will i understood this at the time and in those days after my failed suicide attempt i drove the point home with every basic exercise i did i’d given up on myself had wanted to kill myself because i was too weak to overcome my addictions my life was no longer in my control chemicals ruled me postsuicide i knew that i had to get stronger in so many ways at the time getting more capable physically seemed the easiest and most essential phase of my overall rehabilitation anyone who knew me any betting person informed of my track record would have laid their money down against my succeeding taken the over and under at somewhere between five and ten days i don’t blame them for being doubtful i didn’t have much of a past that i could draw from empty optimism is a fragile thing but with each day of sobriety and each day’s workout totals exceeding the previous one i built a framework to support the what the fuck do i have to lose mentality that defined those earliest days of my transformation desperation sometimes makes us cowards and sometimes makes us courageous at least i was making a good choice by trying that’s what i’ve been told my dad grew up dirt poor and less and though as far as i can remember i never asked him about why he chose to have us live a more redneckbluecollar kind of life than their combined salaries might have earned them i suspect now that our home on the river was some approximation of what back in iowa he’d envisioned as an idealized existence rather than rolling fields of corn we had a river high desert plains to the east and the highest peaks of the rocky mountains just an hour’s drive to the west colorado was his escape from what i would later learn was a childhood that made my pain seem like nothing in comparison that’s not an excuse for what he did to me and vice versa i can’t say that his verbal and mild physical abuse caused me to fuck up my life so completely i can’t say that my hatred for him was a direct result of how he treated me the headwaters of his anger and frustration with me and the world were a distant trickle of a stream that went back eons something more suitably measured in geologic time fathers and sons epic battles for dominance it often feels that way to me now as if the tensions between us predated both his and my time on earth we were just carried along in a current more powerful than either of us knew i can’t say with any certainty that i remember more or less about my childhood than other people do i don’t know if that’s attributable to all the drugs i took the general fallibility of memory but i do remember some things with a clarity that startles me i remember my dad taking me to the playground my mom and my brother trent weren’t there it was just him and me him pushing me on a swing me gliding away and then returning later that day he was gone for a while and then back again what pushed him away i don’t really know like a drop of some catalyst placed in a solution a few things crystallize one of the earliest pictures i remember seeing of my dad and me is one of him squinting fiercely into the sun a crooked grin splitting his face a can of budweiser hoisted up alongside his cheek condensation running down it like sweat and tears my freshly squeezed head resting under his other    things were tough between them for a time early on she saw signs she knew but she chose to wish them away they met one night when breathless and panicked he came storming into a friend’s house where she was visiting the cops were after him and he needed some place to hide he immediately tapped into the wellspring of my mother’s essential nature here was someone who needed help it didn’t hurt that he was goodlooking and charming that despite his desperation he managed to be both polite and dangerous one thing led to another and they were dating and married he did a stint in the army and that discipline and order seemed to tame or at least put to good use the rampant spirit that coursed through him who knows how his tour of duty in vietnam might have twisted or straightened him out he wasn’t about to share his feelings with anyone i couldn’t have articulated this then but as a kid i always sensed that my dad was willing himself to stay within some boundary to me he was like an electrified fence wires strung taut between two poles emitting a faint hum and a hairraising pulse of energy that you could detect only when you got too close from a distance you wouldn’t know that danger existed i remember for the weeks that my dad was gone not feeling or hearing any of that audible and inaudible static crackling through the house my mom said that i have the same energy he did only instead of it being contained it spilled out all over i pictured one of those kid’s toys the popcorn popper like gadget with the plastic bubble the wheels and the wooden t handle i imagined myself toddling around the house with that thing loving the racket it made with its riot of balls spitting around i also imagine my father seething at the disquiet i created reaching into the refrigerator for another cold one to drown me out i do know that until he went into rehab my father drank every day and i can’t remember a time from those early days when he didn’t have a beer can in his hand or nearby god bless mom but she couldn’t bring herself to elaborate too much on what i was like as a preschooler other than that i was a handful a kinetic presence who instead of being stilled when a hand is placed on the thigh transfers the energy to the party hoping for calm i was a human stadium wave a perpetual commotion machine i was released into the outdoors temporarily as if i was some semidomesticated pet a squirrel or a raccoon or something like that who was still feral enough to be destructive but cute and cuddly enough to be kept as a fond oddity not without its charms and value as bad as things could be with dad i hated the idea of being without him he seemed to sense that and like the ultraloyal labrador retrievers he bred bullied and occasionally beat i always came back for more worse was when i shrank from him like the runt of the litter he grew up hard and he wanted me to be the same way if i shrank from him or flinched before he slapped me it seemed to piss him off even more one incident sums up what it was like growing up and the worries that nearly consumed me i was eight and a half and my dad was taking us with him to the grocery store i must have asked one too many questions he slammed on the brakes yanked the wheel so that we wound up on the shoulder he flatsided me just behind the ear and with his eyes bugging out he leaned in really close his face growing larger as i pressed myself against the door to escape shut up you dumb fuck keep it up and you’re going to drive me to drinking again message delivered i was the cause of his anger i would be the one who drove our family apart in time i grew to hate him found unfathomable his demand that i at the age of five drown our peahen’s newborn chicks while he stood over me watching with a glazed look of pride and perverse pleasure you’ve got to be a man he seemed to be saying and that meant suffering and causing others to suffer eventually i’d learn what demons possessed him but until that revelation when i was thirteen he was a mysterious and fearinducing force in my life he was smart too around my mom he exhibited little of his rage and seldom directed any of it toward me my little brother trent was spared his wrath almost entirely i could only come to one conclusion about my circumstances it must have been me i must have been what tore my dad up so badly that he had to retaliate and treat me so horribly later on as a teen when i was really acting out my buddies and i used to laugh at someone falling down or doing whatever to hurt themselves and say that’s going to leave a mark well for better and worse that’s what my dad’s anger did to me whatever confidence i might have developed in myself was stillborn in that toxic environment i lived in a confused world of pain and pleasure and love and hate in time i’d find a way to numb myself to that world of hurt as a young adolescent i was merely along for the ride as a teen i’d find refuge in drugs and alcohol i became intent on hurting my father one solution my mom and dad discovered for my agitating presence was to open the door and let me outside—i could do less damage out there be less of a pest to be honest i didn’t mind being turned loose into the outdoors while i wasn’t actively involved in any kind of sports being able to ramble around the woods and along the river gave all my energy an outlet my buddy tom howie and i spent hours wandering around hunting with our bb guns fishing with our dads and generally living a huck finn–tom sawyer kind of existence him with the kind and loving family me always on edge with a volatile father while fishing required me to sit still something i was loathe to do most other times i did it because when my dad was enjoying himself he was a pleasure to be around fishing seemed to soothe whatever ailed him and i was always happy to be around him when our two energy fields matched in 1986 when i was eleven we moved to mission viejo california when my mom accepted a transfer there i was sad to leave tom and the rest of the boys back in loveland and at first i hated life in a planned community with its uniform rows of houses and no place to really roam and explore but i soon discovered a couple of other passions the ocean seemed to have a magnetic pull on me and i couldn’t get enough of bodyboarding in that activity i found another release for my abundant energy the first time i saw people paddling out into the surf and riding those waves back in i was enthralled the first time i tried it i was hooked i befriended a korean kid in the neighborhood by the name of kwangsun kwang no one called him kwangsun but his parents and i frequently rose before dawn on weekends and caught the bus to newport beach and the wedge or to san clemente and t street the best surfing beaches in the area i was one of those kids who was undisciplined at school and earned decent but not exactly exemplary grades and after just about every parentteacher conference my mother reported back to me that my teachers thought that i needed to focus better and work on disciplining myself in the sixth grade i was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder and from that point on considered myself a marked young man having to march down to the nurse’s every day to take my meds my earliest experience doing a perp walk tore me up everyone knew where i was going and what i was doing and i might as well as have been asked to wear a sign saying trouble around my neck while i did it i hated viscerally hated being labeled with that disorder and everyone and everything to do with it i associated every authority figure—teachers doctors school administrators and even the police with whom i’d had a few early encounters—with a vast conspiracy to deny me the right to be me yes i was full of energy but instead of helping me find ways to channel that energy they tried to medicate me into a dull and lifeless little droid yes i’d flipped off a substitute teacher and gotten sent to the principal’s office but the guy was a douche bag i was the new kid and i was just trying to impress everyone and make a few friends it was a fucking joke and not worthy of a suspension yes i couldn’t stop talking in class but did any of them ever get sick and tired of sitting in a confined space for hours a day being beaten on with words in 1988 when i was in the sixth grade my parents took me in for my first psychological evaluation angry impulsive inattentive low selfesteem are the highlights of that initial diagnosis before the drugs and the alcohol bodyboarding and surfing provided me with a purpose and a direction i could go to the wedge my preferred locale because it was a bigger thrill and spend hour after hour working on perfecting a move i didn’t stop for lunch i didn’t stop because my arms ached from all the paddling i didn’t stop when my failure to kick out soon enough found me thrashed onto the beach and then sucked back out by a riptide i had focus i had discipline i just didn’t exhibit those traits when and where everybody else said that i should demonstrate them in hindsight i can see that bodyboarding fed another of my personality traits i was a bit of an adrenaline junkie from early on the wedge was formed by a jetty that ran about a quarter mile out from the shore because of how it sits its angle to the swell it could pitch up pretty quick by southern california standards it was a really thick wave and the bigger and dicier the surf the more i liked it just as in colorado when either i became too much for my family to handle or my energy threatened to overspill its boundaries i’d find refuge outside one day in particular in 1990 i needed that kind of release and relief i’d been told that we were going to have to leave southern california mom had been transferred back to the home office in bloomington illinois i looked at a map and about puked there was the ocean there were the rockies and then there was this vast blankness at which to my geographically impaired mind sat bloomington illinois tensions were high in the house mostly stirred up by me but my parents tried to assure me that things would be even better in bloomington all i could focus on was the fact that it had a twin city by the name of normal who the fuck would want to live near normal normal didn’t work for me i always wanted to go my own way that included how i handled the few chores i was given as my time in southern california rapidly drew to a close my patience for the mundane order of life in our house shrank into something about the size of a bb i was also getting pretty sick of my dad being on my ass about everything ralph niemeyer had very high standards that he expected me to meet i don’t know if it was his time in the army that drilled into his head the idea that anything worth doing was worth doing right and that good enough is never good enough it has to be your best i’d heard words like those my whole life i had a paper route my parents seemed to be doing okay financially so i didn’t have an allowance strictly speaking but i did have to do some chores one of those was washing the cars my dad had his method a cool rinse to begin a hand wash with warm soapy water dishwashing liquid and not and i repeat not clothes detergent administered with a terry cloth towel followed by another cool rinse with the hose—and goddamn it keep that nozzle at least six inches away from the car’s body panels and paint—and then a hand dry using a chamois cloth specifically made for automobiles a dried bit of leather that had to be wetted in order to dry the car and not scratch its surface no drying in vigorous circles that might produce whorls in the glossy topcoat either straight lines and frequent rinses and rewetting of the chamois my father might have had the patience and luxury of time on saturdays to spend the hour or so it took to do a single car i didn’t in addition to having other chores to do i had places to go and people to hang out with to whom i was not genetically linked so i’d do what i considered to be a thorough job of washing the cars none of the easily visible surfaces showed any signs of dirt my dad got down on his hands and knees looked at the area beneath the doors and shook his head he showed me a finger smudged from the rocker panels and said do it again i don’t know what it was about that particular saturday but when he told me that i had to start over i lost it i don’t know if it was because earlier he’d said that my scrubbing of the bathroom and the toilets in particular wasn’t good enough and this latest failure to meet the international ralph niemeyer cleanliness standards was just one more outrage i couldn’t endure but i said to him no i’m not doing it again i did it it’s done i’m done you want it better you do it he came back out of the garage tugging at the waistband of his blue dickies work pants and wiping his hands on a red shop rag you think you’ve got it tough here don’t you i do it sucks my dad shook his head and let out a heavy sigh he spread his feet apart a bit and settled into an armsfoldedacrosshischest stance that had him rocking back and forward on his heels and toes for a minute i saw the tiny muscles and tendons in his jaw quiver and then settle he glared at me he didn’t say anything and i stood there thinking of my friend tim and his mother when i first moved and met him he showed me a small dresserdrawer filled with cigarettes and condoms he said his mom provided him and he wasn’t the only one with parents like that there were lots of single moms and divorced dads with partial custody who’d indulge their kids every whim greg’s mom and john’s mom would throw them parties while my dad was on my ass if i left my wet suit that i’d paid for with my own money out in the backyard to dry without rinsing the salt water off it he’d ream me for not taking good care of all the shit i had and i was at an age when i was hanging out with a lot of kids with a lot of different backgrounds and not a single one of them had a dad who was as strict as mine he was better about not hammering me with his namecalling and ego deflating but he was still on my ass all the time about doing better my dad and i were still engaged in a kind of stare down my heart was pumping pretty good but i wasn’t really scared i was jonesing to get the fuck out of there and go to the beach with my best friend kwang and the longer this went on the less time i knew i’d have to ride the best waves of the day but i didn’t give in instead the little arsonist in me woke from his saturday morning sleep in and said some of the shit you do to me would be child abuse if i went to the cops and told them i thought of the few slaps to my head he’d delivered over the years my dad’s initial physical response caught me off guard he laughed i looked away for a second watched a neighbor’s automated sprinklers rise up and sputter to life as if they sensed the fire that i’d started no son you don’t know a good goddamn about anything you haven’t had a man more than twice your size come after you and pound you in the face and literally kick your ass so that you couldn’t sit for days he stopped and then it was his turn to look over at the sprinklers and their prismatic display and all that was on a good day on a bad day your uncle would come after you he swallowed hard a couple of times and chewed at his lips his next words were stillborn strangled things that died nearly halfway to me but whose spirits carried the gap that’s another kind of thing and i hope you don’t know what i mean by that i forced myself to not think about what that meant so go on then get the fuck out of here if you think you’ve got things so bad my dad turned and walked into the shade of the garage i heard a few tools rattling around i stood rooted in place when my dad came out again he appeared startled to find me there just forget what i said and get on out of here i don’t need your help i hate you i said the words expressing something that i thought and felt was genuine and those words were never truer than in that instant as i stood there listening to my dad reveal to me the abuse he’d suffered as a kid i was fucking pissed off at him at a world where shit like that went on at him for telling me these things for making me fucking feel like i was the one who should have told him that i loved him that everything was going to be okay that he was a good man that i saw and appreciated how hard he worked i did want to do some of those things and i did appreciate him for how hard he worked and how demanding he was i just wanted him to not be so relentless about it all  three humans are bundles of contradictions wrapped in flesh i think i’d known that for a long time even in the middle of the shit storm that was my adolescence and young adulthood but only now with the clarity of nearly a decade of sobriety and the maturation of the new postsuicide shane am i able to articulate just how the contradictory nature of existence played out in my life along with struggling against being labeled as an add kid and hating every other attempt to have me placed in any other category i had a tortured relationship with control labeling and in particular the add diagnosis being slapped on me and having doctors school administrators and my parents all conspiring to medicate the energy out of me pissed me off to the extreme i can see now that those people were mostly well intentioned and their desire to help me control my behaviors was a worthwhile end goal at the time and still to a certain degree today i see it as an attempt to annihilate the essential qualities that made up me they were trying to kill off that shane who they felt was overexuberant and too often out of control in a way then my suicide attempt was part of a larger pattern when you can’t control something by any other means then the next logical step is to kill it at that point in april 2004 i’d known for more than a dozen years that my major problem was that i couldn’t control my alcohol and drug intake at their height my habits consisted of a daily dose of a fifth of vodka a twelvepack of beer and two grams minimum of black tar heroin and as much as i could get my hands on other days that i’d inject my addictions had total control over me as i saw it the only way that i could break their grip on me was to break me very often suicidal people express their belief that killing themselves is the last effort they can make to seize control of a life that has spun wildly out of their grasp i believe that statement to be true while this might sound a little too twelvestepish for my taste since alcoholics anonymous helped me but wasn’t the beall and endall of my sobriety but i’d admitted that i was powerless against my addictions a long time before i tied that makeshift noose around my neck who knows maybe i was just replacing one noose for another but i also believed for many years prior to my failed attempt to kill myself that i was going to die young had come close several times in car accidents and overdoses so as i saw it all i was doing was bringing things to a more hasty conclusion it was as if i was tired of watching this show weary of its repetitive nature and just fastforwarded it to the end skipping all the commercials and redundant scenes as human beings we all want to believe that we are in control of our fate and it’s no accident i chose an individual sport to be my salvation as much as i found baseball and soccer boring i also chafed against the notion that my winning and losing were tied to the efforts of other people i couldn’t control how they performed and yet the outcome of the game was almost wholly dependent upon them possessing the skills desire and savvy that were equal to or greater than my own bmx racing was not like that and when i read that article about dave scott and the kinds of effort he put into training how it didn’t just occupy one part of his life but subsumed all else under a kind of umbrella i knew that was what i needed in order to stay clean and reform my life i knew that for me no middle ground existed i was either going to continue to be completely out of control or demand of myself almost perfect selfdiscipline in certain ways prison was both the ideal environment for me to be in as i began my training and the worst possible place i had none of the facilities that i would need in order to swim or cycle and only a very limited space in which i could run or work out prison did help in that its daily schedule exerted some influence over my behavior in another of those contradictory phenomena i had all the time in the world to concentrate on my new fitness regime but i was also living in a highly structured environment that dictated to me when i could eat when i could be out of my cell etc obviously i can’t say how things might have turned out but it’s unlikely that outside of prison i would have been able to initiate and then follow through on my program those first few weeks were incredibly hard schedule and facility issues aside simply because i had long since lost the discipline the selfcontrol that i’d had as a kid when bodyboarding and bmx racing were so important to me i can see now that one of the reasons why i lost control over myself was that i felt that there were forces working against me that were even more powerful than my own desires that sounds a bit overdramatic when you consider that in 2011 200000 families relocated due to work transfers those numbers didn’t matter to me back in 1990 when my parents told me that we were leaving southern california for the midwest and bloomington illinois my parents cited that 200000 figure and i could have given them 200000 reasons why i didn’t give a fuck about those other 199999 cases all i cared about was me and what this meant for me my parents tried to paint a rosy picture a return to their midwestern roots a chance for me to have a fresh start in a new school where all my disciplinary problems my less than stellar academic success could all be wiped away and i’d have that proverbial blank slate from which to begin again all i saw was what i was going to lose as i had lost when we moved from colorado i was being displaced from an environment that i loved i’d lost the mountains and forests and i now was going to lose the ocean i’d lost one place where my father and i experienced something approaching communion had found a form of that in california and now that was being taken away from me i pleaded with my family to let me stay and live with kwang and his family what was an adrenaline junkie like me going to find there that might compare with the ocean—a cornfield eventually i would find my thrills in bloomington but they mostly were found initially in liquid form eventually herbal and then chemical in nature imagine this we lived on a golf course and that was my chosen sport for a while compare hitting a drive off the first tee into the fairway to the pleasures of riding a wave and you have some small measure of understanding of how far i’d fallen on the excitement scale in retrospect though i can see how golf might have helped me it is a game of concentration and discipline but my highenergy nature couldn’t appreciate its benefits back then i had to control golf and turn it into a game that suited my temperament that meant that eventually playing the game wasn’t enough sneaking onto the course at night stealing golf carts and drunken joyriding around the course offroading and abandoning the vehicles in sand traps doing donuts in the fairways became par for the course and of course the fuel for that fun was alcohol when i lived in mission viejo i knew kids who drank and my best friend kwang and i agreed that consuming alcohol was stupid and not something we’d ever do who needed it we were having enough fun without it and when you’re sober and you see someone who’s fucked up they seem like idiots eventually i’d be the idiot and not the observer inevitably i would combine alcohol and drug consumption with my search for an adrenaline rush i was the kid in high school who had to climb out of the car window and spiderman myself across the windshield while my admirers drove along at 40plus miles an hour i loved the idea that i could outdrink and out crazy every one of my peers so what if my playing chicken along illinois highway 51 three years after we moved resulted in me sustaining a broken leg and a fractured skull—neither of which prevented me shortly after my discharge from the hospital with a dayglo orange cast on my leg stealing a case of beer from a local gas station then confronted by the police stating with a straight face if not a straight blood chemistry that it must have been some other dude with an orange cast on his leg who had committed the offense then there was the incident i told my mother about in what i thought was my last conversation with her the car wreck the lighter pressed to flesh the months the wound took to heal i hated bloomingtonnormal at first i was glad to be the fish out of water the california surfer dude with the nonfarmer tan and the glint of mischief in his eye i got attention immediately and that was cool i kind of bought into my mom’s notion that i was going to be able to have a fresh start there at parkside junior high nobody told me about transcripts that my past wasn’t really my past but an extension of my present and the perceptions my teachers had about me some kids have a highly refined sixth sense they can walk into a classroom for the very first time and spot the kids they’re going to hang out with it’s as if those other kids emit an aura that lets you know to which group they belong all kids want to fit in and i desperately wanted and needed to after having moved halfway across the country but being the alien that i was i struggled those first few days to get a good read on what niche i would fit in not all kids possess that innate belongingrecognition ability and if they don’t possess that keen instinct life can be pretty harsh until they figure it out my status as an outsider and a novelty earned me attention but not always positive attention even in the first few days of school i’d picked up on a vibe as i rode the bus in there seemed to be a territorial distinction between kids like me who lived along the country club and those in an adjoining newly constructed subdivision apparently country club living and all it connotes rankled those kids in that neighborhood and touched some inferiority nerve that forced them to overexaggerate the economic disparity between the two areas we were all pretty solidly middle class and white so the whole thing seems ridiculous now but some jerkoff countryclub kid was on my ass immediately the first weeks of the new school year apparently i was dragging our group’s reputation down i put up with his shit for a couple of days but i knew that this was a situation that required budnipping before it grew out of control i had been in a couple of schoolyardneighborhood scuffles nothing more than shirtcollar grabbing and chest shoving really but i felt like i had to do what i had to do both of us got off the school bus at the same stop our encounter started with namecalling and then escalated to punches and face grinding into the dirt and grass to be honest i don’t know who won the fight mostly what i remember is someone coming up afterward and sticking his hand out to help me back up hey dude that was awesome i’m brian i knew brian krull from school or rather i’d see him and recognized something about him that i liked brian had this big wedge of hair that fell in a sharp angle across his face and that hid one eye it wasn’t his looks that struck me it was his idon’tgiveashitaboutanything demeanor that i picked up on immediately when called on in class brian had the disarming and infuriating habit of saying almost immediately no thank you to the teacher his mix of being polite and a prick intrigued me i was all kamikaze frontal attack in my classroom disruption techniques and brian seemed stealthier brian and i became friends very quickly and i learned equally fast that his mastery of the subtle ran deeper than just being a classroom dipshit brian lived near me and in no time we were at each other’s houses after school we would wander the neighborhood together and eventually tommy ryan and pat would join our little group one night brian suggested that we head over to a new subdivision i’d had my own experience with construction sites and most of what kwang and the rest of that crew did was lob dirt bombs against the plywood sheathing or through the spaces where the windows would eventually go brian raised that ante considerably today i’m surprised that the construction company developing that area did this but after the workers went home at night they left behind air compressors they were chained to the 2 × 4 studs but still we could fire them they also had locked boxes of power tools brian broke into one of them that night and powered up a pneumatic nailer and fired off a bunch of rounds we all got into that action and i can still hear the coughing and rattling sound of that nail gun echoing through the semioccupied streets when a porch light went on we’d duck for cover flattening ourselves against the framed walls and onto the sawdustcovered floors rap music was popular among us suburban white boys and we fell under the sway of the gangsta lifestyle portrayed in some of those songs eazye’s and mc ren’s ruthless villain was one that we listened to all the time and it became inspiration for brian in particular i guess he got tired of messing around on the golf course or in the homes under construction one night brian said boys i gots me a plan he laid it out for us and i immediately thought there was no way i was going to join him in breaking into people’s houses my face must have betrayed my anxiety hey homes don’t be playin’ the pussy on us you can’t be scared of doing this shit brian’s eyes had a way of bugging out of his head and twisting his face into an expression of disbelief and mockery that would later remind me of the actor jim carrey as the riddler in one of the batman movies pat immediately said that we were nuts and went home why brian was so bent on breaking into people’s houses wasn’t clear he had moved to bloomington from somewhere in the south and hated the new place almost as much as i did he also had very strict parents like mine tried to be but his were superreligious it was clear that he was rebelling against all that i hated the idea of sneaking into someone’s house and every time i did it with brian i had this queasy this is not right feeling in my guts i’d done my share of shoplifting and in my obviously very skewed sense of morality i saw that as being okay i wasn’t taking anything from an individual i was taking it from a company a corporation some nameless faceless someone miles and miles removed from my locality our little onandoff crime spree lasted a few months i didn’t always go with brian he and his brother seemed to be really determined to make this their after school jobs or something the local paper reported on the incidents kids around school some of whom we had victimized started talking about it and of course the police were involved by the time word got out the police figured it was schoolkids and not some real criminals i was out anyway i finally had the nerve to tell brian that i was not going to do it anymore he agreed that since so much heat was on us we should cool it for a bit my reasoning was different but i didn’t explain that to him i couldn’t deal with the guilt i tried to imagine what it must have been like for those people to come home how violated they felt when they learned that a stranger a criminal had been lurking around in their house even later when my criminality reached a much higher level i told myself that i wouldn’t resort to residential burglary wouldn’t steal from a civilian and i didn’t i had to use that twisted sense of right and wrong a few weeks before school let out the police had been coming by the school to do some investigating the gossip machine had let us know that the bloomington police had made a cast of a couple of pair of boot prints they found in the dirt underneath a window of one of the burgled houses this was a cinderella and her glass slipper situation they were going to go around and check on various suspects hoping to match the boot print with an actual boot sure as shit a few days after the cops were first seen at the school there was a knock at the door and two members of bloomington’s finest eyeing me menacingly and asking to see my mom and dad i let the cops in and went into the family room where they were watching television as soon as i said the word police my dad’s face froze he shut his eyes and shoved himself out of his lazboy recliner i watched him walking away with his stifflegged gait all the while hoping that as he rubbed the back of his neck he wasn’t thinking about how he’d like to wring mine i had to go down to the police department headquarters in bloomington to be interviewed but i never gave up my buddies or myself and neither did any of the others we all simply claimed that we didn’t know nothing about anything to do with anything later out in the car my dad said well finally there’s something you’re good at playing dumb suits you i ignored his putdown mostly because he was right i was in too much pain from clenching my anal sphincter for so long i hated that feeling of knowing that every syllable i uttered could spell doom or glory for my sorry little punk ass still a tiny voice inside my head let me know that i’d done good that i’d passed the test that the crew was still intact i’d managed to take control of a situation that threatened to spiral into the ground i’d pulled out of the dive and lived to fight another day i do understand now how twisted this all sounds but back then i was hooked on something maybe even more powerful than the alcohol and drugs i would begin to consume all my buddies kept telling me how smart i was this flood of positivity soaked into and nourished the scorched earth of selfworth that my father had left behind i suppose that the reason why our friends are our friends is because they make us feel good about ourselves in brian i’d found someone with whom i could commiserate about being hauled out of an environment i loved and thrived in that first year in illinois i was spiraling into the ground the breakins were just one part of that some of this might have been just the usual adolescent hormonal maelstrom but i got angrier and angrier and became impossible to live with i remember being in my room listening to pink floyd’s the wall for probably the twentieth time that week i know i wasn’t alone in feeling that the double album was an anthem to my personal sense of isolation of being a rootless and wandering soul buffeted around by forces large and small and completely out of my control i’d always loved music but during my school years in bloomington i craved its comforts and the wall spoke to me in its soothing and discordant tone that particular day my mother walked in on me would you please turn that down was only halfformed on her lips before i started in on her what the fuck do you want get your ass out of here my mom would almost visibly shrink as if she was a boxer on the ropes i can’t say why i acted out that way but i can say that for a lot of that time i felt like i had a fever i saw events taking place through a kind of haze much like i would later when i was in a druginduced state other times it was as if the camera through which i was viewing my actions and other people’s responses came into hyperfocus sharp edged and with prominent highlights and shadows as if my brain was photoshopping every image depending upon my mood it would either leach out the color leaving everything dark and gray or hyperbright and gaudy but mostly it was lifeless and dull compared to the weather and the terrain in southern california and colorado with their dazzling sunshine and crystalline blue skies bloomington was gray and my emotional weather matched it when i wasn’t out with friends i moved like i was underwater the one constant was that i was angry angrier than i had ever been especially around the house even though the major irritant in my life had been my father and he wasn’t there i was still pissed off my dad had taken a job in chicago working at the museum of science and industry and he was away during the week this was another of those contradictions his being gone gave me the freedom i craved but still i didn’t like the idea of him being away of how that set me apart from my peers and of how when he was around he ratcheted up the discipline to make up for his absence how sad i was that my life had changed so much from what i’d enjoyed in southern california i was a bundle of confused emotions and my poor mother bore the brunt of it some define depression as sadness manifested as anger turned inward i’m not sure i was ever formally diagnosed during this period as suffering from depression my inner anger spilled over the levy of my personal boundaries and ravaged the lives of my family washing away whatever peace there was in a torrent of angry retribution they tried to snag whatever branches they could to avoid being carried downstream little did we all know that we were then presently navigating relatively calm waters that the rocks and severe rapids were several bends beyond our vision my dad and i had begun seeing a counselor in 1990 to help us resolve some of the issues that we had with one another and then in april 1991 the whole family was in treatment i don’t recall much of the specifics of any of these sessions really i did not want to be there though i did pick and choose my times to air my grievances against my dad he had grown so tired of me and my shit that out of sheer frustration he started to threaten me whenever i made some outrageous statement about doing harm to my mother and my brother those were idle threats but even as the words were coming out of my mouth i knew it wasn’t in any way acceptable to be saying them telling your mother and brother that you’re going to kill them especially when you live in a house where guns are located and where i’d written large my lack of control in a series of fist holes punched through drywall in various rooms around the house had to be taken seriously i had sustained boxing fractures to each of my hands without having taken a swing at another person i can see that now but back then my mother and father’s every effort to deescalate the drama and the threatened violence just made me ratchet up the threats and the acting out they each had a foot on my throat trying to crush my spirit everything they did to try to help me was just another brick in a wall that would inevitably—a design failure of my own devising—come crashing down i do recall sitting in dr mel french’s office one day in 1991 still during my freshman year at normal community high school this was toward the end of the school year and administrators had already made it very clear that i wasn’t going to be welcomed back for my sophomore year my options were to be placed in some alternative education program the district offered or to go to private school i couldn’t believe that my family was conspiring with the fucktards at bloomington to make me leave another place when i’d just started to settle in and make friends a few weeks after that brian came by and something else took control of my life we’d gotten into the habit of sitting on a hip roof that jutted out from beneath my bedroom window the configuration of the house’s rooflines put us in a blind spot for anyone looking out of any of the other upstairs windows we sat there looking out across the fairways to where his house and the others in that part of the development were litebrite blocks of yellow illumination lighten up asswipe nothing can be that bad he handed me the bottle of boone’s farm i took a drink not for the first time and felt the green apple adhere to my tongue and cheeks i just want to get the fuck out of here go back to colorado or california quit your bitchin’ brian’s mocking tone wasn’t what i really wanted to be hearing at least you’ve got cool places to miss i wish that i could be in south carolina how fucked up is that i’d started to drink a bit but never to the point where it penetrated my angsty anger that changed when the new school year rolled around i was at central catholic high school cchs in bloomington another few pointless words about fresh starts another chance for me to make some nice friends not like those nasty kids at the public school who were such a bad influence little did my parents know that the kids at cchs and its wonderful christcentered education was actually its own little sodom and gomorrah just as i had at school my freshman year at cchs i immediately glommed onto kids whose main focus of their studies was how to violate as many of the ten commandments in as many creative ways as possible i don’t recall exactly how i met ryan hornby but we soon became best buddies ryan had already turned sixteen and was driving to school a real pos honda civic hatchback the shade of a chlorinefaded bluegreen diving board and i was able to bum a ride off of him—if not to school at least back home instead of taking me home that day we stopped at his place i don’t recall there being any special reason why on that day we decided to break into his dad’s liquor cabinet ryan said that his dad didn’t drink anymore and he wouldn’t notice if anything was missing he grabbed a bottle of wild turkey and said let’s roll we drove out beyond my folk’s house into some of the surrounding farmland we pulled over on one of the dirt roads that bisected that area one set of wheels in a small ditch the others still on the roadway ryan twisted the top off the bottle and took a swig the liquor sloshing around and then making that gulping sound as it settled back in i took the bottle and did as my buddy had done back and forth the bottle went the two of us not talking just sitting there with the world tilted 20 degrees off of center the lines of barbwire fencing and utility poles and wires like a blank musical staff receding into the distance after four or five hard pulls on the bottle the bourbon was having its effect and for the first time i really felt i understood pink floyd’s comfortably numb i was right there in that sweet spot not quite numb but certainly comfortable the alcohol made me feel warm i was pleasantly buzzed and after a few more swigs and another half hour or so i was wasted i felt so calm cocooned is the best way that i can think of it nothing else in the world existed except for me the front seat of that honda civic and what felt like warm honey that coated my esophagus and heated my belly i was still seated but i wasn’t aware of my ass against the velour and vinyl i was disembodied just a brain and a few sensory receptors for a lot of my life i realized in those moments of initial intoxication i’d been hearing a bunch of white noise and a highpitched whistling like when you’re driving at high speed with your car windows down for a long stretch you only notice that sound when you raise the windows hear that little suck belch as the glass seals and then the pleasant stillness i’ve heard it said that male adolescents are just a bundle of anxieties covered in skin alcohol is a cureall for that hyperanxious state they live in it emboldens the weak and the strong and relaxes inhibition it set me free from all my worries and insecurities i simply didn’t care about anything and i felt wonderful very quickly after that afternoon with ryan and the wild turkey i was drinking every day frequently sneaking off of campus to grab another two or three of the beers we’d stashed somewhere nearby getting alcohol was seldom a problem if we couldn’t get it through a fakeid connection or a legalaged aider and abettor we stole it from our own houses from liquor stores gas station minimarts or wherever whether it was the classic rock we listened to or grunge we heard plenty of songs sung in praise of the liberating effects of drugs and alcohol in short order i couldn’t get through a day much less a boring school day without some help every morning jason would pick me up along with this kid i only knew as d we instituted what is known as wake and bake we’d get stoned before school just to make those hours in the classroom bearable i developed the habit of keeping a bottle of johnny walker red label in my room at home i’d drink a third to a quarter of that bottle every night just to offset the tense vibe that fucking house had seemed to absorb into its very paint and woodwork the best way that i can put it is that alcohol was like a magic elixir producing an idon’tgiveafuckaboutanythingintheworld sensation the effects it had on me were so powerful that i wouldn’t have traded those substances for the secret to transmuting lead into gold pot on the other hand made me more introspective i’m sure that i did my share of puking but i don’t really remember any of those occasions i do know that i had no stop mechanism in me—except when the keg was dry everyone was broke and all the stores were closed and while shoplifting the shit was okay burglary wasn’t—i could never drink just two or three beers or do one or two shots of alcohol i was somebody who hated boundaries of any kind so how could i expect me to limit myself i didn’t see it that way back then all i knew was that if a buzz was good and wasted was better then drinking until i passed out was the best beer was okay but that was for the kids with the cups at the parties that were a regular fixture of every weekend in bloomington that was for the quarters playing beer bong and buzz amateurs who needed a fucking game to keep their epiglottises bobbing not me this was no game this was my life and don’t you fucking get in my way of living it you can have your miller lite your bud light and you can shove that heineken shit up your heinie i was only interested in the mad dog old english 40’s colt 45 malt liquor liquor and none of that pussy drink those sad sacks of shit will blow chunks with later i did have one resolution in those early days of my excess no powders or anything else that could be snorted nono not me i’m a drinker i’ll fire up a spliff but that just means that i party nothing more everybody does this shit i just happen to do it longer and better if my dad thought my playing dumb was my only real ability then why wasn’t he proud of me when i came home wasted after drinking everybody under the table i was keg master at many of the blowouts not because i wanted to be the good host the center of attention but because that keg was my fucking lifeline and extension of my digestive and alimentary canal hollywood 2009 paparazzi fourdeep elbowed each other along the red carpet my husband patton mugged for the cameras in his smart blue pinstriped suit flashbulbs deluged a dozen hands thrust microphones from behind the metal barricade adam sandler appeared attention shifted clamor ratcheted then judd apatow jonah hill chris rock it was monday july 20 2009 a little after six pm we were at the arclight cinemas in hollywood for the premiere of the movie funny people somewhere there’s probably an unused photograph of a celebrity and in the background is a woman in a black shift dress and comfortable shoes i look dazed and exhilarated and am staring at my iphone because at that moment as some of the world’s biggest stars brush against me i’ve just learned that a fugitive i’d been hunting for and obsessing over a double murderer on the run in the west and northwest for the past thirtyseven years had been found i dodged behind a concrete column and called the one person i knew would care about the news as much as i did pete king a longtime reporter for the los angeles times who now worked in media relations for the university of california he picked up right away pete do you know i said i could barely get the words out fast enough know what i just got an email with a link to a news story there’s been a shootout in some remote mountains in new mexico two people are dead a sheriff’s deputy and the guy they were after a kind of mysterious mountain man stealing from cabins no pete said yes i said they fingerprinted the mountain man i admit i paused here for maximum dramatic effect joseph henry burgess i said pete we were right he was out there all this time i hear terry keating before i see him he works as a drummer and drum teacher and his booming voice is probably a result of either hearing loss or a habit of yelling at his students to be heard it’s terry he shouts i look up from my phone as i stand waiting for him and see a mediumsize white guy with a flop of brown hair holding a venti starbucks cup he’s wearing levi’s and a green tshirt that says shamrock football but he’s not talking to me he’s crossing the street toward 143 south wesley avenue the corner brick house in oak park illinois where we have agreed to meet he’s calling out to a man in his fifties working on a car in the driveway the man is tall lanky slightly stooped his once dark hair gone gray he’s got what is sometimes unkindly referred to as a hatchet face there is nothing warm about him but there’s something familiar he bears a strong resemblance to the family who lived in the house when i was growing up some of the kids were close to my age and i knew them from around town he must be an older brother i realize and either bought or inherited the house from his parents the man looks at terry with no recognition i see terry is undeterred and unease washes over me i have a mother’s instinct to reach out redirect and quiet down but i can see terry wants to distinguish himself in the man’s memory they are old neighbors after all i’m one of the boys that found the body terry shouts the man stares at terry from the side of his car he says nothing the blankness is emphatically hostile i look away directing my gaze at a tiny virgin mary statue planted in the northeast corner of the front lawn it’s saturday afternoon june 29 2013—an unusually cold and windy day for midsummer chicago in the sky a block to the west i can see the steeple of st edmund catholic church my family’s old church where i went to school from first through third grades the man returns to tinkering with his car terry peels off to the right he spots me thirty yards down the sidewalk i light up at eye contact and wave furiously at him compensation for what just transpired terry was a year above me at st edmund’s the last time i remember seeing him was thirtyfive years ago i know little about him aside from the recent discovery that the same night in august 1984 changed both our lives michelle he shouts walking toward me how’s hollywood we hug awkwardly his manner brings me back immediately to the oak park of my childhood the flat vowels in his thick chicago accent the way he announces later that he has to haul ass he’s got a cowlick a raw pink color to his cheeks and an utter lack of artifice no calculating mechanism filters his thought from speech he starts in right away so yeah what happened was he says leading me back toward the house i hesitate maybe it’s fear of the already unhappy homeowner’s reaction maybe it’s my sense that walking might help transport us to that muggy summer night when we still rode bikes but had tasted our first sip of beer i look south down the alley how about we retrace the path you guys took that night oak park borders the west side of chicago ernest hemingway who grew up there famously referred to it as a town of wide lawns and narrow minds but that wasn’t my experience of the place we lived in a drafty threestory victorian on the 300 block of south scoville a culdesac in the center of town north of us was the frank lloyd wright home and studio and an affluent neighborhood of prairie homes and liberal professionals intent on staying hip my friend cameron lived in one of the wright homes her stepfather was a civil rights attorney and her mother was i think a potter they introduced me to vegetarian salt and the word kabuki i remember the stepfather recommending that cameron and i who both tended toward black smocks and confessional verse cheer ourselves up by going to see the talking heads’ concert movie stop making sense south of us was mostly bluecollar irish catholic families the houses were always a few degrees too cold and the beds lacked headboards occasionally a father would disappear with a twentyyearold never to be seen again but there would be no divorce a college friend who spent sophomore year spring break with my family was convinced that my father was doing a comedy bit when he began updating me on the local gossip the last names she said were so exclusively defiantly irish the connellys the flannerys the o’learys and on and on i overheard a weary irish catholic mother from oak park field a question about my family once how many mcnamara kids are there she was asked only six she said she had eleven my family had a foot in both sides of oak park my parents were natives members of the tribe commonly referred to as west side irish they met in high school my father was gaptoothed and jolly he liked to laugh my mother was the teetotaling eldest daughter of two hard partiers she loved judy garland and had a lifelong fascination with hollywood people used to tell me i resemble gene tierney she told me shyly once i didn’t know who that was when i saw laura years later the mysterious central character who shared my mother’s cascade of goldenflecked brown hair and delicately cut cheekbones mesmerized me the story is that my parents got together when my father knocked on my mother’s door looking allegedly for a friend of his i believe it the indirect approach to emotional matters suited them they both had enormous eyes my father’s blue my mother’s green that expressed with great feeling what they frequently could not my father briefly considered the seminary while away at notre dame they called him brother leo my mother considered other suitors and doodled alternate possibilities of her future last name but brother leo decided the seminarians didn’t drink enough their friend rev malachy dooley officiated their wedding the day after christmas 1955 my eldest sister margo was born the following september tease my mother with a raised eyebrow about the math and her cheeks burned her nickname in high school was goody twoshoes after northwestern law school my father went to work for the firm jenner and block downtown he stayed thirtyeight years most days began for him in a chair on our screenedin front porch one hand holding the chicago tribune the other a cup of tea and ended with a very dry beefeater martini on the rocks with a twist when he decided to get sober in 1990 he announced the news in his usual quirky way each child received a typewritten form letter to my favorite child it began i’ve decided to join the pepsi generation he later claimed that only two children believed the salutation i was one of them my siblings arrived in quick succession four girls and a boy i was the youngest born after a sixyear gap my sister closest to me in age mary rita was too much older than me to be a real playmate looking back now it feels as though i was born into a party that had started to wind down by the time i came around my parents had matching lazboy armchairs our front door was partly glass and standing there you could see the back of my mother’s beige armchair in the living room when any of the kids’ friends rang the doorbell she’d stick her hand up and make a circling motion go around she’d shout directing them to the unlocked back door the families on our block were close but the kids were all the same ages as my older siblings they ran in a pack and returned home at dusk i have a keen memory of what it was like to be a teenager in the seventies because i spent a lot of time with them my sister kathleen ten years older was and is the most extroverted of our family and she toted me around like a beloved toy i remember teetering precariously on the back of her banana seat as she pedaled to the jewel grocery store on madison street everyone seemed to know her hey beanie they called using her nickname in beanie’s freshmen year of high school she developed an allconsuming crush on anton a quiet blondhaired boy who ran track she took me with her to one of his meets we hid high up in the bleachers to peek at him i remember the lovewrecked expression on her face as we watched him explode forth from the starting line i didn’t realize it then but i was losing her to the complexities of high school soon i was sitting alone on the top of the back stairs that connected our kitchen to the second floor watching teenage boys in sideburns chug beers in our breakfast nook as the steve miller band’s the joker played too loud everyone in my family speaks mock reverently about the day in 1974 when the van sisters—lisa my age kris a year older— moved in across the street thank god they tease what would we have done with you many of my parents’ closest friends were from grammar school and high school that they’d maintained such close bonds in an increasingly unmoored and transient world was a point of pride for them as it should be but it also had the effect i think of insulating them take them out of their comfort zone and they became a little ill at ease i think an undercurrent of shyness ran through them both they gravitated toward bigger personalities they used humor sometimes sharply to deflect tension my mother especially seemed always in a state of suppressing— emotions expectations she had small freckled hands and a habit of tugging her fingers when things got unpleasant i don’t mean to give the wrong impression they were bright curious people who traveled the world once they could afford to my father argued and lost a case in front of the supreme court in 1971 that’s still studied in constitutional law classes they subscribed to the new yorker they always had an interest in popular culture and what was considered good or cool my mother allowed herself to be taken to see boogie nights i’m going to watch the sound of music twenty times in a row to forget that she said they were kennedy democrats politically progressive my mother liked to say but socially conservative my father took my older sisters when they were ten and eight downtown to see martin luther king speak they voted for mondale in ’84 but when i was nineteen my mother once woke me at dawn in a panic shaking a handful of unfamiliar to her pills she couldn’t bring herself to say pill you’re on the   she said fiber i said and turned back to sleep but then our relationship was always fraught my sister maureen remembers coming home when i was around two and finding my mother pacing the front porch i don’t know if i’m crazy she said fighting tears or michelle my mother was forty then she had endured alcoholic parents and the death of an infant son she was raising six kids with no help i’m sure i was the crazy one her lifelong nickname for me only halfjokingly was the little witch we buttonpushed our whole lives she stonewalled i glowered she scribbled notes on envelopes and slid them under my bedroom door you’re vain thoughtless and rude a notorious one went concluding but you’re my daughter and of course i love you very much we had a summer cabin on lake michigan and i remember one afternoon as a kid playing in the waves as she read a book in a chair on the beach i realized that the waves were just high enough so that i could remain underwater and then rise for a quick breath when the wave was at its highest shielding me from view i let my mother straighten up and scan the water i let her put down her book i let her stand i let her run toward the water preparing to scream only then did i pop up nonchalantly i wish now that i’d been kinder to her i used to rib her about the fact that she couldn’t bear to watch certain scenes in movies or on tv shows she couldn’t take scenes in which someone threw a party and no one came she avoided movies about salesmen down on their luck the specificity was what i found peculiar and amusing i now see it as the mark of a deeply sensitive person her father was once a successful salesman whose career bottomed out she witnessed her parents’ problems with alcohol and the insistent mime of merrymaking that went on too long i see her vulnerabilities now her parents valued social success and dismissed signs of my mother’s quick eager mind she felt thwarted she could be undermining and cutting in her remarks but the older me sees that as a reflection of her own undercut selfimage we swim or sink against our deficits in life and she made it a point to encourage me in ways that she had not been i remember that she dissuaded me from trying out for cheerleading in high school don’t you want to be the one cheered she said she thrilled at any of my academic or literary successes when i was in high school i came across a letter she’d started to write years before to aunt marilyn my father’s sister who was a theology professor and accomplished archaeologist my mother was looking for advice on how to best encourage me as a young writer how do i make sure she doesn’t end up writing greeting cards she wrote i thought of that question often in future years during the many periods when i would have been ecstatic to be paid to write hallmark greetings but i felt her expectations the transference of hope and i bristled i both yearned for her approval and found her investment in me suffocating she was both proud of the fact that she had raised a strongminded daughter and resentful of my sharp opinions it didn’t help matters that my generation was deep into analysis and deconstruction and hers was not my mother didn’t or wouldn’t navelgaze in that way i remember talking with my sister maureen once about the severe short haircuts we all had as children doesn’t it seem like mom was trying to desexualize us i asked maureen the mother of three suppressed a laugh mixed with irritation wait until you have kids michelle she said short haircuts aren’t desexualizing they’re easy the night before my wedding my mother and i had our biggest blowout i was unemployed and adrift not writing or doing much of anything and i’d put a lot of time—too much probably—into the wedding at the rehearsal dinner i seated small groups of people who didn’t know each other together the only thing i told them was that they all had one thing in common and had to figure out what it was at one table everyone had lived at some point in minnesota another table was avid cooks in the middle of dinner my mother came up to me as i was making my way toward the bathroom i’d been avoiding her because a friend had made the mistake of telling me that earlier in the evening she’d remarked to my mother that she thought i was the best writer she knew oh i know i think so too my mother said but don’t you think it’s too late for her her words stung and batted around in my head all night i saw her out of the corner of my eye coming toward me in retrospect she was smiling i could see she was pleased with everything she was never good at giving compliments directly i’m sure she thought she was being funny she gestured at the tables you have too much time on your hands she said i turned and faced her with what i’m sure was a mask of pure rage get away from me i spit out she was shocked and tried to explain but i cut her off walk away from me now i went to the ladies’ room locked myself in a stall and allowed myself to cry for five minutes then went back out and pretended that everything was fine she was by all accounts devastated by my reaction we never spoke of it but shortly after the wedding she wrote me a long letter detailing all the things about me that made her proud we slowly rebuilt our relationship after that in late january 2007 my parents decided to take a cruise to costa rica the boat would leave from a port south of los angeles the four of us—my husband patton and i and my parents—had dinner the night before their trip we laughed a lot and i drove them to the dock in the morning my mother and i hugged tightly goodbye a few days later the phone in the kitchen rang at four am i didn’t get up then it rang again but stopped before i could get to it i listened to the voice mail it was my father his voice sounded strangled and almost unintelligible michelle he said call your siblings click i called my sister maureen you don’t know she asked what oh michelle she said mom died my mother a diabetic had fallen ill on the ship due to complications from her disease they helicoptered her to san josé but it was too late she was seventyfour two years later my daughter alice was born i was inconsolable for the first two weeks postpartum depression my husband explained to friends but it wasn’t newmom blues it was oldmom blues holding my newborn daughter i got it i got the love that guts you the sense of responsibility that narrows the world to a pair of needy eyes at thirtynine i understood my mother’s love for me for the first time sobbing hysterically almost unable to speak i ordered my husband to go down into our dank basement and find the letter my mother had written to me after the wedding he spent hours down there every box was overturned papers littered the floor he couldn’t find it  shortly after my mother’s death my father sisters brother and i went to my parents’ apartment in deerfield beach florida to sort through her stuff we sniffed her clothes that still smelled like happy perfume by clinique we marveled at her bottomless collection of bags a lifelong obsession each of us took something of hers i took a pair of pinkandwhite sandals they sit in my closet still afterward the seven of us went to an early dinner at the sea watch a nearby restaurant overlooking the ocean we’re laughers my family and we told stories about my mother that made us laugh seven people laughing loudly create a scene an older woman with a bemused smile came up to our table as she was leaving what’s the secret she asked i’m sorry my brother bob said to such a happy family we sat agape for a few moments no one had the heart to say what we were all thinking we’ve just been cleaning out our dead mother’s belongings we dissolved into more shrieking laughter my mother was and will always be the most complicated relationship of my life writing this now i’m struck by two incompatible truths that pain me no one would have taken more joy from this book than my mother and i probably wouldn’t have felt the freedom to write it until she was gone  i walked the same half mile to st edmund’s every day a left on randolph a right on euclid a left on pleasant the girls wore gray plaid jumpers and white shirts the boys a mustardcolored collared shirt and slacks ms ray my firstgrade teacher had an hourglass figure and a thick mane of caramelcolored hair and she was always upbeat it was suzanne somers herding a bunch of sixyearolds even so she’s not my most vivid memory of st edmund’s nor curiously enough is any catholic teaching or time spent in church though i know there were a lot of both no st edmund’s will always be welded in my mind with one image that of a quiet wellbehaved boy with sandy brown hair and ears that stuck out a little danny olis my schooltime crushes ranged wildly in physical and personality type but i can say with confidence that they all shared one thing—they sat in front of me in class other people are able to develop feelings for people sitting next to them or behind them but not me that requires connecting with someone too directly sometimes even craning your neck to make full eye contact too real i loved nothing more than the back of a boy’s head i could project endlessly on the blank slate of a kid’s slouched back he could be sitting there with his mouth halfopen or picking his nose and i’d never know for a dreamy projectionist like me danny olis was perfect i don’t recall thinking he was unhappy but i also can’t picture his smile he was selfpossessed for a little kid and slightly solemn as if he knew something the rest of us gaptoothed fairytale believers would eventually find out he was the sam shepard of our firstgrade class i’d been gifted with a stuffed curious george when i was born and something about danny’s round elfin face and big ears reminded me of my george doll i fell asleep clutching him to my cheek every night my love for danny was big news in our house sifting through my old stuff during a move once i came across a card beanie had written me during her freshmen year at the university of iowa dear mish i miss you how’s danny olis i switched to the local public school william beye elementary for fourth grade my best friends the van sisters who’d saved me from loneliness by moving in across the street went there i wanted to be with them i wanted to wear whatever i liked after a while i mostly forgot about danny olis my curious george disappeared along with my other childhood things one night in my junior year of high school a friend was helping me prepare for a big party i was throwing while my parents were out of town she’d been hanging out the last few months with some boys from fenwick the local allboys catholic high school and asked if a few of them could come to the party sure i said actually she told me tentatively she was sort of dating one of them just kind of she said that’s great i said what’s his name danny olis my eyes widened and i half guffawed half shrieked i steadied myself and took a breath the way you do when you’re about to share a big secret you’re not going to believe this i said but i had the biggest crush on danny olis in grade school my friend nodded it started in music class because the teacher made you hold hands she said my confused expression prompted her to continue he told me she said i recalled nothing about holding hands and music class and he knew in my memory i was the quiet girl who sat in the back faithfully but discreetly observing every swivel and dip of his head now it seemed my fixation had been about as subtle as a telenovela i was mortified well he’s very mysterious i told her a little irritated she shrugged not to me she said that night teenagers with solo cups spilled onto my lawn and into the street i drank too much gin and ducked and weaved through the throngs of unfamiliar people in my house boys i’d dated were there and boys i would date someone played suspicious minds by the fine young cannibals on repeat all night i was acutely aware of a quiet sandyhaired boy standing in the corner of the kitchen near the refrigerator his hair now covered his ears his face had lost its roundness and was more drawn but through quick glimpses i could see the steady cryptic expression remained all night i avoided him i never looked him in the eye despite the gin i was still the girl in the back of the classroom watchful never watched  twentysix years later one afternoon in may i was preparing to close my laptop when the familiar ring announced a new email i glanced at my inbox i’m an inconsistent email correspondent and sometimes i’m a little ashamed to admit it takes me several days or longer to respond the name in my inbox took a moment to register dan olis i clicked on the message hesitantly dan who was now an engineer living in denver explained that he had been forwarded a profile of me that ran in the notre dame alumni magazine the article sleuth reported that i was the author of a website true crime diary that attempts to solve coldcase homicides the writer asked the origin of my obsession with unsolved murders and quoted my reply this all started when i was 14 a neighbor of mine was brutally murdered very strange case she was jogging close to her house the police never solved it everyone in the neighborhood was gripped with fear and then moved on but i never could i had to figure out how it happened that was the soundbite version another version is as follows on the evening of august 1 1984 i’m basking in the hermetically sealed freedom of our house’s renovated thirdfloor attic bedroom every kid in my family spent part of their teenage years up there it’s my turn my father hated the attic because it was a firetrap but for me a fourteenyearold tsunami of emotions who signed her journal entries michelle the writer it’s a glorious escape the carpet is deep orange shag the ceilings slanted there’s a bookcase built into the wall that swings open to a secret storage nook best of all is the enormous wooden desk that takes up half the room i have a turntable a typewriter and a small window that overlooks my neighbor’s tiled roof i have a place to dream in a few weeks i’ll start high school at the same time threetenths of a mile away kathleen lombardo twentyfour is jogging with her walkman along pleasant street it’s a hot night neighbors out on their porch watch kathleen go by about nine fortyfive pm she has minutes to live i remember hearing someone walk upstairs to the second floor—my sister maureen i think—and a murmured conversation an intake of breath and then my mother’s footsteps going quickly to the window we knew the lombardo family from st edmund’s word trickled out quickly her killer had dragged her into the mouth of the alley between euclid and wesley he cut her throat i had no particular interest in crime aside from reading the occasional nancy drew book growing up yet two days after the killing without telling anyone i walked to the spot near our house where kathleen had been attacked on the ground i saw pieces of her shattered walkman i picked them up i felt no fear just an electric curiosity a current of such unexpected searching force that i can recall every detail about the moment—the smell of newly cut grass the chipped brown paint on the garage door what gripped me was the specter of that question mark where the killer’s face should be the hollow gap of his identity seemed violently powerful to me unsolved murders became an obsession i was a hoarder of ominous and puzzling details i developed a pavlovian response to the word mystery my library record was a bibliography of the macabre and true when i meet people and hear where they’re from i orient them in my mind by the nearest unsolved crime tell me you went to miami university of ohio and every time i see you i’ll think of ron tammen the wrestler and bassist in the school jazz band who walked out of his dorm room on april 19 1953—his radio playing the light on his psychology book open—and vanished never to be seen again mention you’re from yorktown virginia and i’ll forever connect you with the colonial parkway the ribbon of road snaking along the york river where four couples either disappeared or were murdered between 1986 and 1989 in my midthirties i finally embraced my fascination and thanks to the advent of internet technology my diy detective website true crime diary was born why are you so interested in crime people ask me and i always go back to that moment in the alley the shards of a dead girl’s walkman in my hands i need to see his face he loses his power when we know his face kathleen lombardo’s murder was never solved i would write about her case now and again and mention it in interviews i even called the oak park police to factcheck some things the only real lead was that witnesses reported seeing an african american man in a yellow tank top and headband watching kathleen intently as she jogged the police debunked a rumor i remember that witnesses had seen the killer exit the el train and begin following kathleen the rumor’s intent was obvious the murderer had slipped in among us from somewhere else the oak park cops gave me the distinct impression that the case was a dead end and that’s where i thought it stood until that day when dan olis’s name appeared in my inbox dan had copied another person on his email to me terry keating i vaguely recognized the name as a boy a year above us at st edmund’s dan and terry it turns out are first cousins they were reaching out to me because they too were haunted by kathleen lombardo’s murder but for different and far more personal reasons in his email dan said hello how are you then got right to the point did you know that some nice st edmund’s boys found kathleen he wrote the experience had been gruesome and rattling for the kids they spoke of it often dan wrote mostly because they were angry—the wellknown accepted theory of what happened to kathleen that night was wrong in their opinion they felt they knew the identity of her killer in fact they had encountered him that night  terry and dan are not only cousins they shared a house growing up dan’s family lived on the first floor terry’s on the second and their grandmother on the third terry and i survey the back of the old place from the alley how many people would that be i ask terry the house is about three thousand square feet at most eleven kids five adults he says just a year apart dan and terry were and remain close that summer was a real transition time for us terry says sometimes we stole beers and got drunk other times we messed around like when we were kids he gestures at the slab of concrete that abuts the garage in the backyard i remember we were playing hockey or maybe basketball that night the group comprised terry danny danny’s younger brother tom and two gradeschool friends mike and darren it was a little before ten pm someone suggested they head down the alley to the white hen a small convenience store on euclid about a block and a half away they went to the white hen all the time sometimes three or four times a day for a kit kat or a coke terry and i head north from the house he spent so much time in this alley as a kid he can spot all the little ways it’s changed it was darker at night back then he says like a cave almost the branches would stick out and hang down more an unfamiliar tree in a neighbor’s backyard draws his attention bamboo he says can you believe it about fifty feet from where the alley intersects with pleasant street terry stops a gaggle of preteen and teen boys shooting the shit as terry recalls them doing can be raucous they distracted themselves with goofball antics this spot haunts him looking straight ahead you can see the mouth of the alley across the street if we’d been paying attention we might have seen her run by he says we might have seen him grab her we cross the street to the alcove behind 143 south wesley avenue the five boys were walking together in a straight line danny was on his right terry remembers he puts a hand on the fence near the garage and rattles it i think this is the same fence but it was painted red then terry says he thought he glimpsed a rolledup rug near the garbage cans kathleen’s legs were very pale and in the dark terry mistook them for a lightcolored carpet then danny who was closest to her shouted that’s a body terry and i stare at the spot alongside the garage where kathleen lay on her back it was clear immediately that her throat had been slashed blood pooled around her feet there was a terrible smell probably her stomach gases terry guesses now darren a delicate kid as terry describes him walked slowly backward to the opposite garage with his hands on top of his head bugging out tom took off toward the nearest back door yelling for help the next moment is where the accepted narrative of kathleen lombardo’s murder diverges from terry and dan’s memory they remember that kathleen still had vital signs but died in the minutes between their discovery of her and the arrival of a swarm of police they remember the detectives telling them they must have just walked up on the guy they remember a man emerging from the alley almost simultaneously as they discovered kathleen’s body he was tall and appeared to be of indian descent he wore a linen shirt opened to his navel shorts and sandals what’s going on here he asked terry says the man never looked in the direction of the body someone’s hurt we need to call the police mike shouted at the man the man shook his head i don’t have a phone he said the chaos of the scene obscures the next sequence of events terry remembers the patrol car pulling up driven by a skeptical uniformed cop with a mustache who asked sarcastically where the body was he remembers the change in tone and urgent radio for help when the cop saw kathleen he remembers the cop’s partner a younger guy maybe even a trainee leaning against the side of the car retching he remembers darren against the garage his hands still to his head rocking back and forth and then a siege of lights and sirens the likes of which terry had never seen before or since seven years later terry happened to carpool to a concert with a guy named tom mcbride who lived a few doors down from the murder scene terry and tom had been enemies as kids in the way you are when you don’t know each other and go to different schools tom terry says was a public as the catholic kids called them but terry discovered that tom was actually a really good guy they gabbed all night weren’t you one of the kids that found that body tom asked terry said he was tom’s eyes narrowed i always thought someone in the neighborhood did it an image came back to terry the man in the open linen shirt the strange way he wouldn’t look at kathleen’s body the way he’d asked them what was going on here when it was clear something horrible was terry’s stomach tightened what did he look like terry asked tom described him tall from india a real creep he was right there when we found her terry said tom’s color drained he couldn’t believe it he remembered clearly that in the clamor after the discovery of the body the neighbor who appeared freshly showered and was dressed in a robe came out his back door to survey the police cars he’d turned to tom and his family who were out on their back porch did he say anything terry asked tom nodded what’s going on here the neighbor said  they never caught her killer and those pieces of her shattered walkman that i picked up at her crime scene are jangling around in my head thirty years later as i steer my rental car onto capitol avenue in sacramento i take it east out of town until it turns into folsom boulevard i stay on folsom past sac state and the sutter center for psychiatry past the empty lots of scrub and scattered oak trees running parallel on my right is the gold line a lightrail transit system that runs from downtown to folsom twentyfive miles east the route is historic the tracks were once used for the sacramento valley railroad built in 1856 the first steam railroad to connect the city with the mining camps in the sierras crossing bradshaw road i spot signs reading pawn and 6 pocket sports bar across the road are petroleum storage tanks behind a rusty chainlink fence i’m at my destination where it all started the city of rancho cordova
